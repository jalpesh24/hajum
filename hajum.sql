This is original Kipling country, of which he wrote so vividly in his Jungle Book. The same abundance of wildlife species exists today in Kanha National Park, which forms the core of the Kanha Tiger Reserve created in 1974 under Project Tiger. The park is the only habitat of the rare hardground barasingha (Cervus Duvaceli Branderi).

Though one of these was subsequently disbanded, the area remained a protected one until 1947. Depletion of the tiger population in the years that followed led to the area being made an absolute sanctuary in 1952. By a special statute in 1955, Kanha National Park came into being. Since then, a series of stringent conservation programmes for the protection of the park\'s flora and fauna has given Kanha its deserved reputation for being one of the finest and best administered National Parks in Asia, an irresistible attraction for all wildlife lovers and a true haven for its animal and avian population.\r\nForest Department guides accompany visitors around the park on mapped-out circuits which enable viewers to see a good cross-section of Kanha\'s wildlife.

Overnight at resort.\r\nKanha National Park: Kanha\'s sal and bamboo forests, rolling grasslands and meandering streams stretch over 940 sq km in dramatic natural splendor. This is original Kipling country, of which he wrote so vividly in his Jungle Book. The same abundance of wildlife species exists today in Kanha National Park, which forms the core of the Kanha Tiger Reserve created in 1974 under Project Tiger. The park is the only habitat of the rare hardground barasingha (Cervus Duvauceli Branderi). In the 1930s, the Kanha area was divided into two sanctuaries: Hallon and Banjar, of 250 sq km and 300 sq km each. Though one of these was subsequently disbanded, the area remained a protected one until 1947. Depletion of the tiger population in the years that followed led to the area being made an absolute sanctuary in 1952. By a special statute in 1955, Kanha National Park came into being. Since then, a series of stringent conservation programmes for the protection of the park\'s flora and fauna has given Kanha its deserved reputation for being one of the finest and best administered National Parks in Asia, an irresistible attraction for all wildlife lovers and a true haven for its animal and avian population.\r\nForest Department guides accompany visitors around the park on mapped-out circuits which enable viewers to see a good cross-section of Kanha\'s wildlife. The best areas are the meadows around Kanha, where blackbuck, chital and barasingha can be seen throughout the day.\r\nMammalian Species: Kanha has some 22 species of mammals. Those most easily spotted are the striped palm squirrel, common langur, jackal, wild pig, chital or spotted deer, barasingha or swamp deer, sambar and blackbuck.\r\nAvian Species: Kanha has some 200 species of birds. Watchers should station themselves in the hills, where the mixed and bamboo forests harbor many species, and in the grassy forest clearings. Water birds can be seen near the park\'s many rivulets and at Sarvantal, a pool that is frequented by wafer birds and the area in front of the museum. The sal forests do not normally yield a sight of Kanha\'s avifauna. Early mornings and late afternoons are best for bird watching; binoculars are an invaluable aid to the watcher.\"'),

Though one of these was subsequently disbanded, the area remained a protected one until 1947. Depletion of the tiger population in the years that followed led to the area being made an absolute sanctuary in 1952. By a special statute in 1955, Kanha National Park came into being. Since then, a series of stringent conservation programmes for the protection of the park\'s flora and fauna has given Kanha its deserved reputation for being one of the finest and best administered National Parks in Asia, an irresistible attraction for all wildlife lovers and a true haven for its animal and avian population.\r\nForest Department guides accompany visitors around the park on mapped-out circuits which enable viewers to see a good cross-section of Kanha\'s wildlife.

Simply insert your image right within the widget settings. Try adding something like a headshot or a photo of your latest weekend adventure — and see it appear automatically.</p>\n<h3>Video Widget</h3>\n<p>A welcome video is a great way to humanize the branding of your website. You can now add any video from the Media Library to a sidebar on your site with the new Video widget. Use this to showcase a welcome video to introduce visitors to your site or promote your latest and greatest content.</p>\n<h3>Audio Widget</h3>\n<p>Are you a podcaster, musician, or avid blogger? Adding a widget with your audio file has never been easier. Upload your audio file to the Media Library, go to the widget settings, select your file, and you’re ready for listeners. This would be a easy way to add a more personal welcome message, too!</p>\n<h3>Rich Text Widget</h3>\n<p>This feature deserves a parade down the center of town! Rich-text editing capabilities are now native for Text widgets. Add a widget anywhere and format away. Create lists, add emphasis, and quickly and easily insert links. Have fun with your newfound formatting powers, and watch what you can accomplish in a short amount of time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center\">Link Boundaries</h2>\n<div id=\"v-8BDWH3QG-1\" class=\"video-player\"><video id=\"v-8BDWH3QG-1-video\" width=\"632\" height=\"342\" poster=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg\" controls=\"true\" preload=\"metadata\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><source src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;\" /><source src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_fmt1.ogv\" type=\"video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;\" /><div><img alt=\"Link Boundaries\" src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg?resize=632%2C342\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></div><p>Link Boundaries</p></video></div>\n<p>Have you ever tried updating a link, or the text around a link, and found you can&#8217;t seem to edit it correctly? When you edit the text after the link, your new text also ends up linked. Or you edit the text in the link, but your text ends up outside of it. This can be frustrating! With link boundaries, a great new feature, the process is streamlined and your links will work well. You’ll be happier. We promise.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center\">Nearby WordPress Events</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4779 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=632%2C465&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=1024%2C753&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=768%2C565&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?w=1126&amp;ssl=1 1126w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Did you know that WordPress has a thriving offline community with groups meeting regularly in more than 400 cities around the world?

These panel headings improve the experience for people using assistive technologies.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/removal-of-core-embedding-support-for-wmv-and-wma-file-formats/\">Removal of Core Support for WMV and WMA Files</a></h3>\n<p>As fewer and fewer browsers support Silverlight, file formats which require the presence of the Silverlight plugin are being removed from core support. Files will still display as a download link, but will no longer be embedded automatically.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-8/\">Multisite Updates</a></h3>\n<p>New capabilities have been introduced to 4.8 with an eye towards removing calls to<br />\n<code>is_super_admin()</code>. Additionally, new hooks and tweaks to more granularly control site and user counts per network have been added.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/23/addition-of-tinymce-to-the-text-widget/\">Text-Editor JavaScript API</a></h3>\n<p>With the addition of TinyMCE to the text widget in 4.8 comes a new JavaScript API for instantiating the editor after page load. This can be used to add an editor instance to any text area, and customize it with buttons and functions. Great for plugin authors!</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/\">Media Widgets API</a></h3>\n<p>The introduction of a new base media widget REST API schema to 4.8 opens up possibilities for even more media widgets (like galleries or playlists) in the future. The three new media widgets are powered by a shared base class that covers most of the interactions with the media modal. That class also makes it easier to create new media widgets and paves the way for more to come.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/16/customizer-sidebar-width-is-now-variable/\">Customizer Width Variable</a></h3>\n<p>Rejoice! New responsive breakpoints have been added to the customizer sidebar to make it wider on high-resolution screens. Customizer controls should use percentage-based widths instead of pixels.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center\">The Squad</h2>\n<p>This release was led by <a href=\"https://matt.blog\">Matt</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17\">Jeff Paul</a>, with the help of the following fabulous folks.

Another 1,000 people joined via livestream from 77 countries to make a total audience of 2,900 participants from 92 countries. The number of attendees on the ground was about one third less than original estimates of 3,000, but everyone who wanted a ticket was able to get one. A team of 221 volunteers communicated on Slack behind the scenes to make the event run as smoothly as possible.</p>\n<p>The event&#8217;s 45 organizers made the presentations more accessible to speakers of different languages with live captioning and real-time audio translation.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/live-captioning.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: WP Tavern\n<p>WordCamp Europe is the leading WordPress event for catching presentations about the ongoing efforts to bring the software to all the languages of the world.

These workshops included topics like Creating a WordPress Theme for the Masses, Intro to WooCommerce, Jetpack tips, and hosting product demos.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sponsors-wceu.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: WP Tavern\n<p>WordCamp Europe had no shortage of swag unique to the event, including a limited edition French plush Wapuu, posters, postcards, socks, stickers for European WordCamps, and other items for sale in the traveling Swag Store.

Traditionally, WordCamp contributor days are held on Sunday after the main event, the day following the after party when many who signed up struggle to make it on time &#8211; or at all. WordCamp Europe attendees generally appreciated having the contributor day scheduled before the main conference and the higher attendance numbers demonstrate the success of this arrangement.</p>\n<p>The after party featured a 1930&#8217;s theme at the Pavillon d’Armenonville.

Rebecca is the founder of <a href=\"https://www.web-savvy-marketing.com/\">Web Savvy Marketing</a>, a web development, design, maintenance, and SEO consulting company based in Michigan and host of the <a href=\"https://www.seobits.fm/\">SEO Bits podcast</a>.</p>\n<p>Rebecca recently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/9seeds-acquires-web-savvy-marketings-genesis-theme-store\">sold her Genesis Theme store to 9seeds</a>, a store she managed and maintained for five years. In this post, she shares ten lessons learned from selling WordPress products.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When <a href=\"https://wanderingjon.com/\">Jon Brown</a> and I started talking about Web Savvy Marketing selling its theme store to 9seeds, it became abundantly clear that I wasn’t just selling him a portfolio of Genesis child themes. Anybody can do that. What I was really selling him was an established process and five long years of making mistakes and creating solutions.</p>\n<p>When I launched our theme store and stepped into the world of developing WordPress products, I was beyond naïve. I had no idea what I was getting myself into and I didn’t know how to run a successful e-commerce business.</p>\n<p>But after a lot of mistakes and course corrections, I found stability, a lot of great customers, and more revenue than I expected.</p>\n<p>Today, I&#8217;m sharing my top 10 lessons learned with you, so I can spare you from falling down the same rabbit holes and pitfalls.</p>\n<h2>My 10 Lessons Learned</h2>\n<h3>Reputation Is Everything</h3>\n<p>I didn’t set up out to create a strong reputation and I honestly didn’t know I was doing it. I was just following the rules given to me by my Grandmother and the basics of business I learned while working for my prior employers.</p>\n<p>What I realized was this – having a strong reputation helps you sell, but it also helps keep you out of hot water when things don’t go as you plan. People are more willing to buy from you, become your brand advocates, and forgive you when you make a mistake.</p>\n<h3>A Strong FAQ Page Is Worth Its Weight in Gold</h3>\n<p>I didn’t see this as a necessary page at first, but once I had the same question asked 100 times, I realized I needed to have an easily accessible page that answered common questions. Our comprehensive FAQ page has saved me time, but it also aided in sales. Visitors receive immediate answers to their questions and they are more inclined to hit the buy button while you still have their attention and interest.</p>\n<h3>Thorough Post-sale Communication Is a Requirement</h3>\n<p>During the first year of our store opening, I was flooded with post-sale emails and inquiries. No one was using our support forum and the option of self-service. I was so annoyed and frustrated it wasn’t even funny. And then something happened.</p>\n<p>I realized it wasn’t the buyers’ fault. I realized it was my fault. I had failed to communicate, provide next steps, and set expectations. Once I took ownership over this issue, I created a follow-up sequence that provided post-purchase instructions on where to go and what to do.</p>\n<p>A magical thing happened – or many things actually. I freed up my time because people stopped emailing me and I had happy customers who actually thanked me for all the great follow-up information. That was a win/win if there ever was one.</p>\n<h3>Email Templates Save Oodles of Time</h3>\n<p>Even with my stellar FAQ page and follow-up emails, I still received inquiries from people who asked similar questions. I learned to create email templates for anything I had to answer more than five times. This reduced my response time from five minutes to thirty seconds. This freed up my time and more importantly, it gave faster responses to my customers, so they were happy.</p>\n<h3>Create Systems to Save Sanity</h3>\n<p>I’m slightly <span class=\"st\">obsessive-compulsive</span> and I used this to our advantage with the theme store. I created project templates for any new theme launch and I mimicked the same type of tight structure I have with large custom website builds.</p>\n<p>We had a template full of to-do items, ownership of tasks, and expected turn around times. This made the design, coding, and launch of a theme very systematic. This in turn translated to faster product launches, fewer mistakes, and a reduction in development costs.</p>\n<h3>Strong SEO Is Your Friend</h3>\n<p>I could not have been successful without search engine optimization. I let SEO lead the way for what we would sell, who we would sell it to, and how we would market the final product. Strong SEO helped me select the right themes to develop, get quick sales, and cover my development costs within a few months of each launch.</p>\n<h3>Social Media Is a Time Suck but Worth Every Minute Invested</h3>\n<p>I have a love/hate relationship with social media. I hate that it takes so much time and it can be so emotionally draining. At the same time, I love that it helps you reach customers around the world and it supports the SEO process. Social media was a life raft in many ways and I don’t think the store or sales would have grown without it.</p>\n<h3>If Things Can Go Wrong, They Will Go Wrong</h3>\n<p>I have felt like this has been the norm for us this last year. Hosting, plugins, payment gateways, and third-party software sites have worn me out. And I’ve had a team to fix everything. You have to expect things to fail and you must have a plan to fix them quickly. It’s the nature of life and business. Learn to deal with issues quickly and to address one thing at a time.</p>\n<h3>Grace Goes a Long Way in Diffusing Bad Situations</h3>\n<p>No matter how hard you try and how hard you work, your customers will have bad days. When that happens you might receive the brunt of their emotions. This is called &#8216;transference&#8217; and in most cases it has nothing to do with you or your product.</p>\n<p>You have to recognize this for what it is and handle it with grace. Close your email, walk away from your desk, or do whatever you have to do to not reply in anger. Instead, you need to let the moment pass so you can reply calmly and with grace. In each situation where I&#8217;ve used this tactic, I’ve had the crazy person reply with an apology, tell me they were having a really bad day, and then thank me for keeping my calm.</p>\n<h3>People Will Steal Your Products, So Try Not to Take It Personally</h3>\n<p>People will steal your work and your products. You’ll find your premium digital products sitting for download on forums and it will break your heart. Don’t let it. Address the situation and move on. Don’t let someone else’s bad juju ruin your mood, day, or momentum. It won’t help the situation and it will drive you crazy if you let it.</p>\n<h2>In Hindsight</h2>\n<p>I loved launching and owning our theme store. I didn’t sell it because I hated it or because it wasn’t profitable. I sold it because it was no longer the best fit for our company and me personally, which meant it wasn’t going to service our customers as it should.</p>\n<p>If I had the opportunity to do things over, I would still launch and I’d follow the same path I did over the last five years.</p>\n<p>The theme store brought me some wonderful employees, great online friends, and it brought me deeper into the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>Selling the store was a hard decision, but the right one.

The release was stable and has been received well, and we were able do the merge and beta <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/4-8/\">a bit faster</a> than we have before.</p>\n<p>When I <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/01/04/focus-tech-and-design-leads/\">originally wrote about the three focuses for the year</a> (and in <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2016/12/state-of-the-word-2016/\">the State of the Word</a>) I said releases would be driven by improvements in those three areas, and people in particular are anticipating the new Gutenberg editor, so I wanted to talk a bit about what&#8217;s changed and what I&#8217;ve learned in the past few months that caused us to course correct and do an intermediate 4.8 release, and why there will likely be a 4.9 before Gutenberg comes in.</p>\n<p>Right now the vast majority of effort is <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg\">going into the new editing experience</a>, and the progress has been great, but because we&#8217;re going to use the new editor as the basis for our new customization experience it means that the leads for the customization focus have to wait for Gutenberg to get a bit further along before we can build on that foundation. Mel and Weston took this as an opportunity to think about not just the &#8220;Customizer&#8221;, which is a screen and code base within WP, but really thinking in a user-centric way about what it means to customize a site and they identified a number of low-hanging fruits, areas like widgets where we could have a big user impact with relatively little effort.</p>\n<p>WordPress is littered with little inconsistencies and gaps in the user experience that aren&#8217;t hard to fix, but are hard to notice the 500th time you&#8217;re looking at a screen.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d be able to sustain the effort on the editor and still do a meaningful user release in the meantime, but we did, and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/06/16/4-9-and-gutenberg/\">I think we can do it again</a>.</p>\n<p>4.8 also brought in a number of developer and accessibility improvements, including <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/04/23/target-browser-coverage/\">dropping support for old IE versions</a>, but as I mentioned (too harshly) in my <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/04/13/first-quarter-check-in/\">first quarter check-in</a> there hasn&#8217;t been as much happening on the REST API side of things, but after talking to some folks at WordCamp EU and the community summit before I&#8217;m optimistic about that improving. Something else I didn&#8217;t anticipate was <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/12/28/supporting-the-future-of-wp-cli/\">wp-cli coming under the wing of WP.org as an official project</a>, which is huge for developers and people building on WP. (It&#8217;s worth mentioning <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-cli/restful\">wp-cli and REST API work great together</a>.)</p>\n<p>To summarize: The main focus of the editor is going great, customization has been getting improvements shipped to users, the wp-cli has become like the third focus, and I&#8217;m optimistic about REST-based development the remainder of the year.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/session/interview-and-qa/\">on stage at WordCamp Europe in Paris tomorrow afternoon</a> doing a Q&amp;A with <a href=\"https://om.co/\">Om Malik</a> and taking audience questions, will also have a few announcements.

The Community Summit was held earlier in the week, lending a strong contingent of veteran contributors to this event, ready to use the short time they had together.</p>\n<p>With a high concentration of WordPress expertise gathered in Paris, WCEU organizers were able to include 13 talks and workshops aimed at enriching contributors. For an event that has always focused on serving diverse communities, it&#8217;s no surprise that many of the contributor projects were focused on growing and improving WordPress through accessibility, internationalization, documentation, and inclusion.</p>\n<h3>WP REST API Team is Writing Docs to Make the API More Approachable to New Users and Contributors</h3>\n<p>WP REST API project co-lead Ryan McCue said their team was concentrated on improving documentation to give developers a better understanding of the REST API infrastructure and how it integrates with the rest of WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The main thing we&#8217;re trying to work on is documentation for this sort of stuff, because we&#8217;re lacking a lot of documentation around the infrastructure,&#8221; McCue said. &#8220;One of the things we don&#8217;t do well is having a way to go from &#8216;I know nothing&#8217; to &#8216;I know this stuff.&#8217; A lot our documentation describes solutions without describing the problem and how you pick a solution.&#8221; Contributors are working on a new set of user guides, which are currently on <a href=\"https://github.com/WP-API\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>, that will eventually be included in the developer handbook.</p>\n<p>McCue said the next major project is completing work on <a href=\"https://github.com/WP-API/OAuth2\" target=\"_blank\">OAuth 2</a>, the new authentication method that will allow users to authorize applications to access data on their sites. He anticipates the team will have a &#8220;very workable plugin&#8221; that could be ready for testing within the next six months.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We need to get this sorted if any of the mobile apps are going to use the REST API,&#8221; McCue said. These apps currently use the existing XML-RPC and WordPress.com APIs. Although OAuth hasn&#8217;t been a major focus so far this year, McCue said the team is looking at changing that going forward.</p>\n<h3>Documentation Team is Working Towards Making HelpHub the Go-To Resource for WordPress Support</h3>\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordcamp-europe-docs-team.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: WordCamp Europe 2017 Photography Team\n<p>John Ang, who helped lead the Documentation team, said they have been focused on writing documentation for new contributors, as well as ensuring current docs are gender neutral and not overly technical so that content writers can understand them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Helping with the project has traditionally been tough, because we don&#8217;t explain how you can get started,&#8221; Ang said. &#8220;We realized this across the entire documentation team. We are great at writing end-user documentation but not great at writing contributor documentation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of the major documentation projects they have been working on for the past few years is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/tag/helphub/\" target=\"_blank\">HelpHub</a>, a companion resource to DevHub that will eventually hold all end-user documentation for WordPress. Migration from the codex is complete and the goal is to retire the codex once the project launches. Docs contributors are working towards making HelpHub the first place that users search for assistance before taking to the forums, lifting some of the burden from support volunteers. HelpHub is being designed to be easily searchable, possibly powered by elasticsearch, with inter-connected articles that focus on a single topic with bite-sized content.</p>\n<p>Ang estimates HelpHub is 30% complete in terms of content and 50% in terms of development. The backend is mostly finished and contributors are now working on the frontend. They are also bringing in content experts to write articles on critical topics, such as security. Ang hopes the team can deliver an MVP by the end of this year and finish the project within the next year.</p>\n<h3>Community Team is Working on Redesigning Central.WordCamp.org to be More Useful to the Wider WordPress Community</h3>\n<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordcamp-europe-2017-community-team-contributors.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>Community Team Contributors &#8211; photo credit: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WCEurope/status/875328517000617984\">WordCamp Europe 2017 Photography Team</a>\n<p>A segment of Community Team contributors are working on marketing events better to the wider WordPress community that is not as well-connected with news about the project. As redesign of <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">central.wordcamp.org</a> is part of this effort.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Overall, the feeling is that we are not getting in front of the people who need our information the most,&#8221; Global Community Team member <a href=\"https://twitter.com/josephahaden\" target=\"_blank\">Josepha Hayden</a> said. &#8220;Most WordCamps are educational. There is an aspirational aspect to all of them, of course. But the people who could use the information the most are, for example, the people who inherited a WordPress site and don&#8217;t know what to do about that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After reviewing Google Trends to see what people are actually looking for when they get to a WordCamp site, the Community Team found that most visitors are searching for a WordCamp and the year. The only reason they get to the site is because they already know the event is happening.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The deputies we&#8217;ve spoken to in the last year or so have been echoing this feedback that the problem our WordCamp organizers have is they don&#8217;t have any way to get the information out to attendees better,&#8221; Hayden said. &#8220;If you already know about WordCamps, it&#8217;s easy to find your local WordCamp but if you don&#8217;t, then it&#8217;s not.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Community Team has begun working on a communication and marketing plan that may include things like automated emails or social media campaigns but their first priority is redesigning central.wordCamp.org.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We realized the first place we need to start is to have a canonical place for them to go,&#8221; Hayden said. &#8220;Central.WordCamp.org was always supposed to be that place but for awhile it had kind of a hybrid audience. We&#8217;re working on identifying the content, who the correct audience is, and what we&#8217;re missing if we want to help somebody who has never heard about any WordPress events.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The discussion around redesigning central.wordcamp.org discussion has been happening for a few years and the team already has a design that was donated. They have the homepage and several other pages complete and hope to have the new site launched by the end of the year.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 00:27:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: Lifted, a WordPress Theme and Plugin Shop for the Marijuana Industry\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=72027\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://wptavern.com/lifted-a-wordpress-theme-and-plugin-shop-for-the-marijuana-industry\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4731:\"<p><a href=\"https://liftedthemes.com/\">Lifted</a> is a new WordPress theme and plugin company founded by <a href=\"http://baltimoredrew.com/\">Drew Poland</a> that caters to the marijuana industry. I reached out to Poland to learn more about his company, his pricing model, and get his perspective on this space in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Why did you decide to get into the marijuana industry with WordPress plugins and themes?</strong></p>\n<p>Two primary reasons. The first is that, I truly believe in its medicinal use and there&#8217;s more than enough research out to support its effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Documentaries like <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/specials/health/medical-marijuana/index.html\">Weed from CNN and Dr.Sanjay Gupta</a> will bring you to tears watching children like Charlotte Figi, who suffer from extreme epilepsy, almost instantly stop the seizures and become functional with the things most of us take for granted like talking and walking.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s tough to watch at times but there are a lot of cases from the extreme ones like end of life and debilitating issues, to everyday pain, stress, and PTSD management that make it a valuable alternative to harder, more addictive prescription drugs like Opioids, that are most commonly thrown at these as a solution.</p>\n<p>The second reason is less inspiring. It&#8217;s simply a budding industry with massive room for growth. It&#8217;s really just now coming around and I think will accelerate as it matures and the path will become clearer in terms of what clients need and want. An entire new industry has opened.</p>\n<p><strong>What are some of the technologies used to power your themes?</strong></p>\n<p>Everything is built the WordPress way so everyday users can for the most part, activate a theme and go. For the most part, its page templates, widgets, and some custom fields. If a user is comfortable with those than they can easily use a theme from Lifted.</p>\n<p><strong>Are your themes and plugins GPL licensed or GPL compatible?</strong></p>\n<p>Absolutely! Everything is 100% GPL licensed.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you determine the price range for Grape Ape $129.99-$379.99 and can you provide an ETA on when it might be released? (I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen pre-orders for a theme before)</strong></p>\n<img />Front page of the Grape Ape Theme\n<p>I simply wanted to come in with a product priced on the higher end because I&#8217;m a firm believer that most WordPress products are priced entirely too low.</p>\n<p>I value my time on the highest level since I can&#8217;t make more of it, so a sell low and at volume approach just doesn&#8217;t work for me. I don&#8217;t want to support a $50 theme and the reality is that if this were a custom project for a client, the budget needs to be $10k minimum.</p>\n<p>The estimated release date for Grape Ape is the end of July.</p>\n<p>The pre-order was a result of simply wanting to force myself to get the actual Lifted Themes site up. Otherwise, I would have waited until Grape Ape was complete and then spent entirely too much time on the Lifted site.</p>\n<p>So I had to settle in with a good-looking theme I could live with and later work with my designer to develop something more custom. Had I really wanted to push the pre-order more I would have ramped up marketing months in advance to build up the anticipation and desire for it.</p>\n<p><strong>Based on your research, how crowded is this space when it comes to WordPress themes and plugins?</strong></p>\n<p>I would say it&#8217;s a clear lane and you can drive as fast or as slow as you like. I have been slow-moving up until this point and had the first marijuana plugin on WordPress.org, so there&#8217;s a lot of room.</p>\n<p>The marijuana industry is also not what I would call mature and at the end of the day there is still a stigma in professional settings. So if you are someone building products on the side or have a lot of clients in a specific industry that isn&#8217;t so receptive, you might not feel comfortable broadcasting that you are working in this space.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any legalities customers should be aware of before using your products?</strong></p>\n<p>If used as intended, no. At its core, Grape Ape is fitted for your typical run of the mill business website, that&#8217;s no different from a coffee shop.</p>\n<p>At the moment, plugins are also in a clear zone. In the future, that may become more of a concern as services and tools are opening their APIs to connect dispensary back office systems with their web presence.

As the focus of Web Savvy Marketing shifted towards larger custom development projects and SEO, Rebbecca Gill, founder of Web Savvy Marketing, needed to find a way to <a href=\"https://www.web-savvy-marketing.com/2017/06/investment-strategy-wsm-selling-genesis-theme-store/\">maintain the theme store</a>. </span></p>\n<p>&#8220;I wanted Chris’ vision to live on and I wanted all my babies to continue to flourish and find their way to websites around the world,&#8221; Gill said. &#8220;I was at a crossroads and I didn’t know what to do.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I needed to make sure the company had a solid long-term strategy, but I also needed to protect our loyal theme customers. Five years of sales meant we had a lot of existing buyers who needed ongoing support.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Last year, Gill met Jon Brown, owner of 9seeds, and established a professional relationship.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have very similar views on business, friendships, and ethics,&#8221; Gill said. &#8220;I liked him right away and I knew I wanted to spend more personal and professional time with him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And as we grew closer, we started chatting about my struggles with the theme store and his long-term business goals. Before I knew it, he wanted to acquire the theme store and I wanted to give it to him.&#8221;</p>\n<p>9seeds has built a number of custom sites for clients using the Genesis Framework. For those who wanted to leverage existing themes, the company has often referred clients to Web Savvy Marketing&#8217;s theme store.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It took a bit more time of getting to know each other personally before I came to hold the same feelings that others had shared about her,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;I felt deeply that this was a person I not only wanted to be friends with but wanted to be in business with. It became apparent to both of us that this was a perfect fit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The acquisition brings the themes in-house and expands 9seeds reach into the WordPress products market.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s a win for 9seeds by giving us a springboard into a market we’ve long had our eye on accompanied by the best trail guide in the business showing us the path,&#8221; Brown said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s a win for WSM by freeing Rebecca and her team up to align with where her focus now is on larger custom site builds and SEO consulting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>9seeds is providing support for existing customers and is working on a new theme. The support forums and theme store will migrate to the 9seeds domain later this year.</p>\n<p>To learn more about Brown and his work with 9seeds, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-276-interview-with-jon-brown-a-traveling-digital-nomad\">listen to episode 276</a> of WordPress Weekly.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 19:18:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"Post Status: An entrepreneurial journey around eCommerce, with Patrick Rauland — Draft Podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=37565\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"https://poststatus.com/entrepreneurial-journey-around-ecommerce-patrick-rauland-draft-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2487:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/draft\">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast\">Google Play</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

Do you feel the WordPress vibrations? It&#8217;s shortly before the fifth WordCamp Europe which will be held in Paris this year. The social channels like Twitter &amp; Co. are flooded with pre-event messages. You can feel the emotions of excitement and sadness in the timeline nearby. People share their excitement about their upcoming attendance and others who can&#8217;t make it. I am a person who belongs to both groups.</p>\n<p>But let me begin some months ago to tell you how this came to be. After WordCamp Europe in Vienna last summer I purchased my ticket for WCEU 2017 in Paris directly after the ticket sale was opened. There was no doubt at all I would participate.</p>\n<blockquote><p>How life&#8217;s play changes, it worked out differently than planned.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;ve struggled with some health issues over several years. Mostly caused by stress during and after the divorce, as well as some deaths in the vicinity. Nothing really serious, but not ignorable. I thought&#8230; But at the end of the summer last year I got seriously ill. Not the right place for details here, but I had to quit my day job in a small agency because the fixed-term employment contract ended at the same time. Also, I had to reduce any contributions to the WordPress project. I had to reduce my freelancing contracts, too.</p>\n<p>I ran from one medical specialist to the other to find the cause of my illness. I was so frustrated not to be able to work like I&#8217;ve done before and so upset about the brain-fog and the fatigue. It was so depressing. As a mom of five children, it is not funny to be ill. The three youngest kids are living at home with me and my new partner. My oldest daughter bought her own house. But I couldn&#8217;t help her while moving. Can you imagine, how frustrating this could be?</p>\n<p>But hey &#8211; I am a fighter like a lioness. I put everything on the plate, invested my small savings into healing treatments and so on.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To make a long story short, I am getting healthier every day.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We found the cause and the healing treatments are helping like expected. Two operations went well. It is a process, but it&#8217;s going forward.</p>\n<p>Sitting at home without a job is not my thing, so I searched for a new day job. I found a part-time employment in my hometown as a head of a tutoring institute. It is ok, but nothing WordPress related. It secures my existence. But my saving balance allowed no budget for WordCamp travels. I gave up thoughts of attending WordCamp Europe in Paris this year.</p>\n<p>So I decided to offer my ticket.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I’v to sell my <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/wceu?src=hash\">#wceu</a> ticket I bought last year. Unless it happens a miracle and there is a sponsor for stay &amp; travel <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WCEurope\">@WCEurope</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/PFWBTtSmlq\">pic.twitter.com/PFWBTtSmlq</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Coach Birgit Olzem (@CoachBirgit) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CoachBirgit/status/867323301399588864\">May 24, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The unexpected miracle happened. I found sponsors for travel &amp; stay without active seeking. My generous sponsors rewarded my past contributions to WordPress and Community over several years with this openhearted support. I am so grateful for this.</p>\n<p>Since 2012 I have been an active member of the WordPress Community. First as the main responsible person for the translations of WordPress into German, then as a part of the international Polyglots team. I am also editor and release manager for local German site and I am a member of some other contribution teams in the WordPress ecosystem. I spent a lot of spare time and money on contributions and WordCamp travels.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Perhaps you can imagine how frustrating it was, that I couldn&#8217;t afford to travel to WordCamp Europe.</p></blockquote>\n<p>An event where I can meet a lot of friends I made over the last years. Even more, I was happy to get the generous sponsoring. I am so grateful!</p>\n<p>In the last two years I had to reduce my contribution time and disappeared from the scene, but I followed the changes and enhancements within the community in the background. Nevertheless I wasn&#8217;t forgotten.</p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s not only me who get help to attend to WCEU:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today is a completely different day. Largely thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jdevalk\">@jdevalk</a> (and team <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yoast\">@yoast</a> ) I WILL be attending. Beyond grateful is what I am.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Remkus de Vries (@DeFries) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeFries/status/874595421112414208\">June 13, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Everyone has had some downs and some ups. If you ask, there is always someone who is willing to help you. It is an example of a mindset from an open-source community like the WordPress community and it reflects the philosophy. You can get everything, but you have to ask. Only speaking people can be helped.</p>\n<p>Apropos speaking people can get helped:</p>\n<p>I have a dream over some years to contribute to WordPress in full-time as a WordPress Community Manager. There are so many things I can do even if I am not a full-stack developer. Perhaps this miracle happens, too. But at this moment I am sitting on my suitcases to write about the generosity in the WordPress Community. This essay wasn&#8217;t planned, but it happened to have been written.</p>\n<p>I am so grateful for my heroes who made it happen, that I can go to the WordCamp Europe this year.</p>\n<p>There are so many unseen heroes outside who need to be seen.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Be open minded, trust yourself and talk about what matters to you.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There is a light at the end of the tunnel.

creating beautiful new themes and continually enhancing the existing themes,&#8221; Danzer said.</p>\n<p>Imagely has been busy this year launching a <a href=\"https://www.imagely.com/websites/\">managed WordPress hosting service</a> for photographers, releasing <a href=\"https://www.imagely.com/wordpress-photography-themes/\">new photography themes</a>, and an <a href=\"https://www.imagely.com/wordpress-lightroom-plugin/\">Adobe Lightroom plugin</a> that allows users to manage NextGEN galleries from within Lightroom.</p>\n<p>Later this year, Imagely plans to release a new version of NextGEN gallery with a redesigned backend interface. The company is also working on a way to add automated print fulfillment to WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Automated print fulfillment allows photographers to sell prints from their websites, and have those prints automatically delivered via the print lab without any intervention on their part,&#8221; Danzer said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This functionality drives many large companies in the photo industry &#8211; SmugMug, ShootProof, Pixieset, Zenfolio, Photoshelter, and others. But it&#8217;s not possible yet on WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Bringing a full print solution to WordPress has the potential to revolutionize the photo industry and make WordPress the default web solution for photographers that it should be.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Marcel Sobieski, co-founder of TeslaThemes, <a href=\"http://teslathemes.com/blog/acquisition/\">thanked customers</a> for their support and confirmed that they exited the company on June 9th.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We built a solid, trusted and valuable business, that is needed on the market and is appreciated both by industry colleagues and clients,&#8221; Sobieski said.</p>\n<p>This is the second exit in the last six months for Sobieski and his team. The sale of TeslaThemes will allow them to focus on a new venture called <a href=\"http://www.wpmatic.io/\">WPMatic.io</a>, a one-on-one WordPress support and development company.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The six years of experience that we have in WordPress is already helping a few hundred clients and tens of companies and agencies in need, right after purchasing a WP Theme from the market,&#8221; Sobieski said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Soon we will start partnering with some of the best WP Theme Clubs to deliver a unique experience for their clients.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The acquisition of TeslaThemes represents Imagely&#8217;s first major move into the general WordPress products market. The company is also seeking acquisition opportunities for other WordPress plugin and theme companies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the coming years, we&#8217;ll be both building and be acquiring a range of other WordPress theme and plugin companies,&#8221; Danzer said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll even add a small call here: if you have a solid WordPress product, with a great brand and stable revenue over around $200,000, and you are looking to exit, feel free to reach out to me directly to chat.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Correction: June 14th, 2017</strong> The article incorrectly identifies Imagely as the creators of NextGEN Gallery.

You can use them for commercial and noncommercial purposes. You do not need to ask permission from or provide credit to the photographer or Unsplash, although it is appreciated when possible.</p>\n<p>More precisely, Unsplash grants you a nonexclusive copyright license to download, copy, modify, distribute, perform, and use photos from Unsplash for free, including for commercial purposes, without permission from or attributing the photographer or Unsplash. <strong>This license does not include the right to compile photos from Unsplash to replicate a similar or competing service. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The inability to compile photos from Unsplash to replicate a similar or competing service is a restriction on how the photos can be used, calling into question its compatibility with the GPL.</p>\n<p>Luke Chesser, co-founder of Unsplash, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lukechesser/status/873146783945416704\">explained on</a> Twitter that individual photos have no restrictions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Unsplash license doesn&#8217;t violate GPL and can still be used in WordPress themes,&#8221; Chesser said. &#8220;There are no restrictions on the individual photos.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is only a restriction on the collection of photos, which doesn&#8217;t even apply unless your intent is to create a similar service.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For example, it&#8217;s ok if someone creates a site that displays the best photos of bridges from Unsplash. But if the site makes those photos available for download, it would <a href=\"https://community.unsplash.com/help-section/do-i-have-to-give-credit-to-a-photographer-when-i-use-their-photo\">violate the license</a>.</p>\n<p>On its FAQ page, Unsplash <a href=\"https://community.unsplash.com/help-section/what-is-the-unsplash-license-and-where-can-i-find-it\">explains why</a> the restriction was put in place:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The fuel that drives Unsplash is the exceptional images that are generously contributed by people from all over the world. Without them, none of this would work. Unsplash would be nothing. We owe everyone who’s contributed a photo not only a thank you but support and empowerment for the gifts they’ve given us.</p>\n<p>Out of respect for our contributors and our ability to uphold our value of empowering creativity, we added this sentence to the Unsplash License.</p>\n<p>We don’t support the mass duplication of Unsplash photos with the purpose of replicating a similar or competing service because it leads to confusion which negatively impacts both the spirit of open creative use and the celebration of Unsplash contributors.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mass compiling of photos from Unsplash to distribute on other sites has created legal issues in the past. &#8220;Sites that mass duplicate and compile Unsplash photos point support and legal issues back to Unsplash, while continuing to redistribute photos that may be removed on Unsplash,&#8221; the company said.</p>\n<p>The reasons cited by Unsplash for putting the restriction in place are some of the same reasons WordPress plugin developers <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-gpl-license-doesnt-provide-the-freedom-to-infringe-registered-trademarks\">register trademarks</a>.

Ó Caoimh said the upcoming release is in a &#8220;stable and usable&#8221; state, but with the unusually large number of bug fixes and new features, it could use some testing in different environments.</p>\n<p>WP Super Cache is set to introduce a REST API, which will be useful for situations where administrators are not using wp-admin to manage their sites. The plugin is also <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pull/177\" target=\"_blank\">changing the location for storing legacy cache files</a> to the supercache directory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This makes it easier to manage these files,&#8221; Ó Caoimh said. &#8220;The plugin doesn’t have to search through potentially hundreds of cache files for those that need to be deleted if a page updates or someone leaves a comment. Now all those files will be in the same directory structure the anonymous “supercache” files will be. I’m really excited about this feature as it makes caching for logged-in users/users who comment and caching of pages with parameters so much faster now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ó Caoimh is also updating the settings page to make it easier for new users to understand the options. Currently it asks the user to select from mod_rewrite, PHP, or Legacy page caching with little explanation for why a user might opt for a certain delivery method. The new settings page simplifies the language used to describe the caching types.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wp-super-cache-new-settings.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The upcoming release will also <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed\" target=\"_blank\">fix nearly 100 bugs</a>. As WP Super Cache is one of the most popular WordPress caching solutions and is active on more than a million sites, any problems with a major release will have a far-reaching impact. The latest changes to the plugin are <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache\" target=\"_blank\">available on GitHub</a> for anyone who wants to help test.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 09 Jun 2017 20:04:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WPTavern: Harare, Zimbabwe to Host Its 2nd WordCamp November 4, 2017\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=71314\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wptavern.com/harare-zimbabwe-to-host-its-2nd-wordcamp-november-4-2017\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3375:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/harare.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/zimbabwe/harare\">Lonely Planet</a>\n<p>Harare, Zimbabwe will be <a href=\"https://2017.harare.wordcamp.org/2017/01/18/welcome-to-wordcamp-harare/\" target=\"_blank\">hosting its second WordCamp</a> on November 4, 2017, at <a href=\"http://www.hellenicacademy.ac.zw/\" target=\"_blank\">Hellenic Academy</a>. The city was one of three selected to be part of the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-incubator-program-to-launch-in-indonesia-zimbabwe-and-columbia\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Incubator Program</a> in 2016. Harare&#8217;s first WordCamp was successful in connecting the local WordPress community and inspiring local leaders to carry on with organizing future events.</p>\n<p>Last year the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Harare-WordPress-Meetup/\" target=\"_blank\">Harare WordPress Meetup</a> had 82 members and the group has nearly doubled in size with 142 members today.  Members meet every month and communicate outside of meetings via an active WhatsApp group. The current venue they use was donated by <a href=\"http://motorepublik.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Moto Republik</a>, thanks to one of the members Munya Bloggo, who works there.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was always the goal of the WordCamp Incubator program to organize an easily-reproducible event that we could organize independently in the years to come,&#8221; 2017 lead organizer <a href=\"https://franksweb.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Thabo Tswana</a> said. &#8220;We expected it of ourselves. Some attendees and organizers actually approached me about the next WordCamp during WordCamp Harare 2016.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tswana said the turnout at last year&#8217;s event was larger than he expected, because very few attendees booked tickets online. The majority ended up buying tickets at the door on the day of the event, a fairly uncommon scenario for most WordCamps that makes it somewhat difficult to estimate total attendees.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the biggest impacts that WordCamp had was introducing us to the WordPress Community,&#8221; Tswana said. &#8220;There are so many WordPress users in Zimbabwe (bloggers, designers, developers) but hardly anyone knew about the WordPress Community or how to contribute to WordPress. We now have a growing meetup group and the local community is starting to become more aware of what WordPress has to offer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The local community consists primarily of developers and advanced WordPress users and Tswana said he would like see more of them getting involved with contributing. As the majority of meetup members are new to the larger WordPress community, they are still learning about the many ways users can contribute back to the project.</p>\n<p>Two Harare WordPress Meetup members, Kudakwashe Zafevere and Rima Trew, arranged for Hellenic Academy to donate a venue for WordCamp Harare 2017. The facilities are well-suited to hosting a tech event with wifi available.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This year, some local companies and organizations expressed interest in helping us out,&#8221; Tswana said. &#8220;We definitely expect more attendees due to the buzz that was created by last year&#8217;s WordCamp. To sum it all up, more people and organizations are getting involved this year.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 09 Jun 2017 02:33:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:118:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.8 “Evans” Released Featuring Nearby WordPress Events, New Media Widgets, and Link Boundaries\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=71534\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:121:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-evans-released-featuring-nearby-wordpress-events-new-media-widgets-and-link-boundaries\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7169:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/\">WordPress 4.8 &#8220;Evans&#8221;</a> is available for download and is the first major release of the year under the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle\">new release cycle</a>. WordPress 4.8 is named after <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Evans\">William John &#8220;Bill&#8221; Evans</a>, an American jazz pianist.</p>\n<h2>New Image, Video, and Audio Widgets</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 includes <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/\">three new widgets</a>. All three widgets make it easier to display images, video, or audio  without using HTML. The Text widget now has support for TinyMCE providing rich-text functionality. Similar to the post editor, users have a choice between using a Visual or Text editor with limited formatting options.</p>\n<img />Image, Video, and Enhanced Text Widget\n<p>Because the Text widget uses TinyMCE, it inherits its nuances when it comes to pasting and displaying code. In a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/23/addition-of-tinymce-to-the-text-widget/\">dev note</a> that explains how TinyMCE was added to the Text Widget, Weston Ruter offers the following notice.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When pasting HTML into the &#8216;Text&#8217; (HTML) tab of the Text widget, any extraneous line breaks should be removed or else unwanted paragraphs and line beaks may result. This is particularly important when you paste in <code>script</code> or <code>style</code> tags (as in the case of 3rd-party JavaScript embeds), since auto-inserted paragraphs will cause script errors; this will be fixed in <span class=\"p2_hovercardify\"><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2833\">#2833</a></span>.</p>\n<p>This behavior aligns with longstanding behavior in the post editor, so it is not new, although it does differ from how the Text widget has previously behaved. As noted above, for previously existing Text widgets that had the auto-add paragraphs&#8217; checkbox unchecked (and thus the <code>filter</code> instance prop set to <code>false</code>), the previous behavior of not doing <code>wpautop</code> will be maintained: only once the widgets are modified will any extraneous line breaks need to be removed.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Link Boundaries</h2>\n<p>Adding and editing links in the visual editor is more intuitive thanks to link boundaries. Link boundaries provide a visual representation of where a link begins and ends. This helps prevent adding unnecessary text to the beginning or end of a link.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>See Nearby WordPress Events in the Dashboard</h2>\n<p>One of the pillars of WordPress&#8217; ecosystem is its community of meetups and WordCamps. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle\">In 2016</a>, more than 62,566 people attended a local meetup in 58 countries. About a third of those were new members.</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 draws attention to these events by <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/03/23/showing-upcoming-local-events-in-wp-admin/\">enhancing the News Dashboard widget</a>. The widget will try to automatically guess your location and display meetups and WordCamps that are nearby.</p>\n<img />News Widget Shows Upcoming Meetups and WordCamps\n<p>If the location is incorrect, clicking the Pencil button opens a box where you can type in your city. The bottom of the widget includes links to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/meetups-landing-page\">WordPress Meetup landing page</a>, <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/\">WordCamp Central Schedule</a>, and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/\">WordPress.org news blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>Responsive Customizer Sidebar</h2>\n<p>In previous versions of WordPress, the Customizer Sidebar had a maximum width of 300 pixels. In WordPress 4.8, the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-increases-maximum-width-of-the-customizer-sidebar-to-600-pixels\">Customizer Sidebar is responsive</a> and its width will automatically increase based on the size of the screen up to a maximum of 600 pixels.</p>\n<img />Customizer Sidebar 345 Pixels Wide\n<h2>More Accessible Admin Pages</h2>\n<p>The headers on admin screens are now <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-improves-accessibility-on-admin-screens\">separate elements</a> making it easier for assistive technologies to help people navigate pages.</p>\n<h2>Support Dropped for Internet Explorer Versions 8, 9, and 10</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/04/23/target-browser-coverage/\">drops support</a> for Internet Explorer versions 8, 9, and 10 as these versions no longer receive security updates and are used by a small percentage of people. WordPress 4.8 will work in these browsers but some features related to TinyMCE will be limited. New features will no longer be tested against these older versions of IE.</p>\n<h2>Noteworthy Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/20/editor-api-changes-in-4-8/\">Changes to the Editor API</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/removal-of-core-embedding-support-for-wmv-and-wma-file-formats/\">Embeds of WMV and WMA files are no longer supported</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-8/\">New Capabilities and others enhancements for WordPress Multisite</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/tag-cloud-widget-changes-in-4-8/\">Accessibility improvements to the Tag Cloud widget</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/\">The addition of a Media Widgets API</a></li>\n<li>TinyMCE was updated from version <strong>4.5.6</strong> to version <strong>4.6.2</strong></li>\n<li>Twemoji was updated from version <strong>2.2.2</strong> to version <strong>2.3.0</strong></li>\n<li>zxcvbn was updated from version <strong>1.0</strong> to version <strong>4.4.1</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This release was led by <a href=\"https://matt.blog/\">Matt Mullenweg</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17\">Jeff Paul</a>. 346 people contributed to WordPress 4.8 and 106 of them were first time contributors.</p>\n<p>If you think you&#8217;ve discovered a bug in WordPress 4.8, read <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/read-this-first-wordpress-4-8-master-list/\">this support thread</a> first to see if it&#8217;s a common issue that&#8217;s already been reported.

Worona can also manage the process of publishing the app for a one-time 290€ fee.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Worona had more than 12,000 users from 150 different countries. After launching its new platform four months ago, more than 11,500 users have signed up.</p>\n<p>Martínez said that Worona differs from existing WordPress app builders in that it is free, user-friendly, completely open source, and extensible.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We studied the WordPress ecosystem and the mobile distribution trends during the last three years and realized that other existing solutions, such as AppPresser, are just focused on one or two mobile channels, but not in all of them,&#8221; Martínez said. &#8220;This can be a problem for publishers, as they have to configure the different channels (apps, web apps, AMP, Facebook Instant Articles) one by one and take care of being consistent with all of them. After launching our own beta in 2015 and testing similar solutions, we decided to develop an all-in-one platform with the vision of becoming the leading solution for mobile distribution.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Worona is also aiming to create an ecosystem of extensions and themes for the platform, allowing third-party developers to create new solutions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The strategy of creating a marketplace of extensions has been successfully accomplished by the WordPress ecosystem before (but not by any of our direct competitors),&#8221; Martínez said. &#8220;WooCommerce, for example, gives you access to a variety of extensions aiming to solve any problems related to your e-commerce. Because it is open-source, these features can be created by any developer or user. The bigger the community, the higher the range of solutions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Worona is currently a team of five, including two co-founders, a marketing specialist, and two full-stack developers. Most of the team will be at WordCamp Europe. They hope the <a href=\"https://blog.worona.org/wceu-paris-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">WCEU Paris Guide app</a> will be useful for attendees and also provide a good introduction to their product. If you have any feedback that would make the app more useful, make sure to <a href=\"https://blog.worona.org/wceu-paris-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">comment on the announcement</a> and Worona may be able to incorporate user suggestions before the event.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:32:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.8 “Evans”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4770\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40312:\"<h2>An Update with You in Mind</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4816\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/release-featured-image.png?resize=632%2C316&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3>Gear up for a more intuitive WordPress!</h3>\n<p>Version 4.8 of WordPress, named &#8220;Evans&#8221; in honor of jazz pianist and composer William John &#8220;Bill&#8221; Evans, is available for download or update in your WordPress dashboard. New features in 4.8 add more ways for you to express yourself and represent your brand.</p>\n<p>Though some updates seem minor, they’ve been built by hundreds of contributors with <em>you</em> in mind. Get ready for new features you’ll welcome like an old friend: link improvements, <em>three</em> new media widgets covering images, audio, and video, an updated text widget that supports visual editing, and an upgraded news section in your dashboard which brings in nearby and upcoming WordPress events.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Exciting Widget Updates</h2>\n<p><img class=\"size-large wp-image-4776 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/widgets-with-all-four.png?resize=632%2C436&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3>Image Widget</h3>\n<p>Adding an image to a widget is now a simple task that is achievable for any WordPress user without needing to know code. Simply insert your image right within the widget settings. Try adding something like a headshot or a photo of your latest weekend adventure — and see it appear automatically.</p>\n<h3>Video Widget</h3>\n<p>A welcome video is a great way to humanize the branding of your website. You can now add any video from the Media Library to a sidebar on your site with the new Video widget. Use this to showcase a welcome video to introduce visitors to your site or promote your latest and greatest content.</p>\n<h3>Audio Widget</h3>\n<p>Are you a podcaster, musician, or avid blogger? Adding a widget with your audio file has never been easier. Upload your audio file to the Media Library, go to the widget settings, select your file, and you’re ready for listeners. This would be a easy way to add a more personal welcome message, too!</p>\n<h3>Rich Text Widget</h3>\n<p>This feature deserves a parade down the center of town! Rich-text editing capabilities are now native for Text widgets. Add a widget anywhere and format away. Create lists, add emphasis, and quickly and easily insert links. Have fun with your newfound formatting powers, and watch what you can accomplish in a short amount of time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Link Boundaries</h2>\n<div id=\"v-8BDWH3QG-1\" class=\"video-player\"><div><img alt=\"Link Boundaries\" src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg?resize=632%2C342\" /></div><p>Link Boundaries</p></div>\n<p>Have you ever tried updating a link, or the text around a link, and found you can&#8217;t seem to edit it correctly? When you edit the text after the link, your new text also ends up linked. Or you edit the text in the link, but your text ends up outside of it. This can be frustrating! With link boundaries, a great new feature, the process is streamlined and your links will work well. You’ll be happier. We promise.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Nearby WordPress Events</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4779 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=632%2C465&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Did you know that WordPress has a thriving offline community with groups meeting regularly in more than 400 cities around the world? WordPress now draws your attention to the events that help you continue improving your WordPress skills, meet friends, and, of course, publish!</p>\n<p>This is quickly becoming one of our favorite features. While you are in the dashboard (because you’re running updates and writing posts, right?) all upcoming WordCamps and official WordPress Meetups — local to you — will be displayed.</p>\n<p>Being part of the community can help you improve your WordPress skills and network with people you wouldn&#8217;t otherwise meet. Now you can easily find your local events just by logging in to your dashboard and looking at the new Events and News dashboard widget.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Even More Developer Happiness <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f60a.png\" alt=\"😊\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/17/cleaner-headings-in-the-admin-screens/\">More Accessible Admin Panel Headings</a></h3>\n<p>New CSS rules mean extraneous content (like “Add New” links) no longer need to be included in admin-area headings. These panel headings improve the experience for people using assistive technologies.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/removal-of-core-embedding-support-for-wmv-and-wma-file-formats/\">Removal of Core Support for WMV and WMA Files</a></h3>\n<p>As fewer and fewer browsers support Silverlight, file formats which require the presence of the Silverlight plugin are being removed from core support. Files will still display as a download link, but will no longer be embedded automatically.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-8/\">Multisite Updates</a></h3>\n<p>New capabilities have been introduced to 4.8 with an eye towards removing calls to<br />\n<code>is_super_admin()</code>. Additionally, new hooks and tweaks to more granularly control site and user counts per network have been added.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/23/addition-of-tinymce-to-the-text-widget/\">Text-Editor JavaScript API</a></h3>\n<p>With the addition of TinyMCE to the text widget in 4.8 comes a new JavaScript API for instantiating the editor after page load. This can be used to add an editor instance to any text area, and customize it with buttons and functions. Great for plugin authors!</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/\">Media Widgets API</a></h3>\n<p>The introduction of a new base media widget REST API schema to 4.8 opens up possibilities for even more media widgets (like galleries or playlists) in the future. The three new media widgets are powered by a shared base class that covers most of the interactions with the media modal. That class also makes it easier to create new media widgets and paves the way for more to come.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/16/customizer-sidebar-width-is-now-variable/\">Customizer Width Variable</a></h3>\n<p>Rejoice! New responsive breakpoints have been added to the customizer sidebar to make it wider on high-resolution screens. Customizer controls should use percentage-based widths instead of pixels.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>The Squad</h2>\n<p>This release was led by <a href=\"https://matt.blog\">Matt</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17\">Jeff Paul</a>, with the help of the following fabulous folks.

The plugin offers a lightweight, elegant popup message for capturing email addresses, displaying a (fake) live chat, or announcing a sale or event.</p>\n<p>Bolinger designed it to be non-intrusive &#8211; it&#8217;s not the kind of modal dialog that obscures content with an animated box in the middle of the page. Holler Box appears at the bottom right-hand of the page by default.</p>\n<p>After finding other WordPress popup plugins to be too complex for his needs, Bolinger decided to create his own solution for displaying a quick notification on his websites.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m a developer, and even adding a simple banner or popup to my site is not easy,&#8221; Bolinger said. I have to write the code, test locally, push to staging, test there, then push to production and do a final test. When I want to remove the message, I have to reverse the process. I’m busy, and that takes time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bolinger made it so that creating a new Holler Box is as easy as writing a new blog post. The content editing screen includes a meta box with options for customizing the display.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/holler-box-meta-box.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The &#8220;Advanced Settings&#8221; meta box allows users to set pages where the notification should be displayed, limit to logged-in only or logged-out visitors, set the display for new or returning visitors, and customize the delay based on time or scrolling. It also gives options for when the Holler Box should disappear and how often it should be shown to each visitor.</p>\n<p>Holler Box is capable of a wide range of uses. A few examples include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>(Fake) Live Chat with Opt-in</strong>\n<p>Show a live chat box to collect customer questions and emails, without having to actually deal with the hassle of live chat. As soon as your visitor types a question, an email opt-in pops up so you can follow up with them at a convenient time.</li>\n<li><strong>Polls and Forms</strong>\n<p>Embed anything into your Holler Box, including a feedback form or poll.</li>\n<li><strong>Interactivity</strong>\n<p>Add a link, video, contact form, or simple opt-in form that integrates with major email providers like MailChimp and Convertkit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below is an example of how the MailChimp email opt-in form works:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/holler-box.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Holler Box also tracks impressions and conversions (link clicks and message opens) so that users can see how well their notifications are performing and optimize them as needed.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/holler-box/\" target=\"_blank\">free version on WordPress.org</a> has an impressive number of customization options, but Bolinger also plans to release a Pro version that will include additional features, such as an option for a header banner, more advanced display filters, automatic message deactivation, advanced email opt-in features, more conversion data, and support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Holler Box aims to be more stylish and easier to use than existing options,&#8221; Bolinger said. &#8220;I use it when I need to make an announcement without spending a lot of time in a complex tool.&#8221; He said he could see the plugin working well side-by-side with well-established popup plugin competitors like OptinMonster.</p>\n<p>Bolinger said Holler Box is not affiliated with AppPresser, but he plans to use it as a sales tool on all of his sites. The plugin&#8217;s unique feature set is something he found missing in WordPress&#8217; marketplace for sales/conversion tools.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think Holler Box will increase sales and conversions without being as disruptive as other popups,&#8221; Bolinger said. &#8220;The sale notification popup and faux live chat feature are really unique. It’s how I want to communicate with my audience &#8211; hopefully other people feel the same.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 08 Jun 2017 01:37:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 276 – Interview with Jon Brown, a Traveling Digital Nomad\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=71482&preview=true&preview_id=71482\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-276-interview-with-jon-brown-a-traveling-digital-nomad\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2848:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me/\">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href=\"https://www.wanderingjon.com/\">Jon Brown</a>.

It&#8217;s stable and usable and runs on this site but we would love more people to test it out before we release a new version.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s just some of the new features and bug fixes we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> The plugin was based on WP-Cache which stored cache files in a single directory, and those (legacy caching) files were for the most part stored the same way all this time but now they&#8217;re being placed in the supercache directories (<a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pull/177\">#177</a>). This makes it easier to manage these files. The plugin doesn&#8217;t have to search through potentially hundreds of cache files for those that need to be deleted if a page updates or someone leaves a comment. Now all those files will be in the same directory structure the anonymous &#8220;supercache&#8221; files will be. I&#8217;m really excited about this feature as it makes caching for logged in users/users who comment and caching of pages with parameters so much faster now.</li>\n<li> We&#8217;re adding a <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/\">REST API</a> to the plugin because in the future not everyone is going to use wp-admin to take care of their sites. Take a look in the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/tree/master/rest\">rest directory</a> for the code we&#8217;re working on.</li>\n<li> Debug logs now have a username and password to protect them from prying eyes.</li>\n<li> And many <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed\">bugs fixed</a> over the last few months.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since &#8220;legacy caching&#8221; or &#8220;WP-Cache caching&#8221; is now more maintainable and faster we <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/issues/224\">want to change the language</a> describing how the plugin caches and delivers pages. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://odd.blog/files/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-07-at-17.35.25.png\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Currently the plugin asks you to choose between mod_rewrite, PHP and &#8220;Legacy page caching&#8221; which isn&#8217;t really useful. Most users won&#8217;t recognise those terms. It&#8217;s also not accurate as &#8220;legacy page caching&#8221; is active all the time as long as caching is enabled.<br />\nInstead we should have &#8220;Standard Caching&#8221; and &#8220;Super Caching&#8221;. Super Caching will then have simple and expert delivery methods.</p>\n<p>Simple delivery is through PHP, while expert delivery uses mod_rewrite rules which means the .htaccess file has to be updated and hopefully the warning below it will discourage casual users from testing it.</p>\n<p>Due to the huge number of changes in the plugin we really need people to give it a try and check if everything works ok. The <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pull/255\">changes to the settings page</a> will hopefully make it easier for new users to get to grips with it too.</p>\n<p>You can find the newest code <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache\">on Github</a>. The changes to the settings page are in <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pull/255\">#255</a> if you want to comment on them. </p>\n<p>Thanks in advance! 🙂</p>\n\n<p><strong>Related Posts</strong><ul><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2011/10/19/preload-categories-and-custom-post-content/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Preload categories and custom post content\">Preload categories and custom post content</a></li><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2008/10/24/wp-super-cache-084-the-garbage-collector/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector\">WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector</a></li><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2009/01/09/wp-super-cache-087/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.7\">WP Super Cache 0.8.7</a></li></ul></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://odd.blog/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Source</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Jun 2017 17:24:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Donncha\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"HeroPress: Trust The Dots\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1890\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"https://heropress.com/essays/trust-the-dots/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=trust-the-dots\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12612:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/060717-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: WordPress is such an amazing melting pot that involves people from everywhere, no matter how old they are, where they are from, or what languages they speak.\" /><p>I was born twice: first, as a baby boy in the sunny morning of Monday June 14, 1993 in Taiz, Yemen; and then again, in the fall of 2008. It was my first time to study at a public high school, grade 10, class 12. It was completely different than the private school I used to study at. It was big and crowded, with a minimum of 80 students in each class!</p>\n<p>At that time, I was trying to improve my personality and explore new opportunities. I wanted to live my life fully, not as the teenager that I was. A way to organize my thoughts and connect with new people was needed. I did not have a clue what to do until the moment I got the chance to use the internet and began to read online blogs of many interesting bloggers. The idea of blogging was fascinating to me. “Why not starting one?” I thought to myself.</p>\n<h3>Finding WordPress</h3>\n<p>As days passed, I met four enthusiastic and ambitious schoolmates who became my friends till now.  Mohammed, one of them, was a relatively quiet and open minded person. My mates and I got to know him through MSN Messenger, and, surprisingly, he was studying in the next class! He was very absorbed in Web Development and was working on a custom CMS platform and some other web applications for his father’s clinic. I asked him about blogging software he would recommend. He strongly recommended Joomla and also suggested Drupal, WordPress and others. I tried them all.</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress was so easy to use and out-of-the-box, although I had failed a few times while I was trying to install it locally. Once I had logged-in to the dashboard, honestly, I thrilled to pieces!</p></blockquote>\n<p>After some time, my friends and I decided to start a simple blog about Graphics Design using WordPress. It was my beginning to learn the basics of Web Development (HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP). Fortunately, Mohammed had a book that he lent me, and some PDFs, that I copied. We were constantly discussing and learning from each other during break times or in the afternoons. They were enjoyable and enlightening moments.</p>\n<p>I used to receive some positive messages as the developer of the blog we started and appreciative replies to my answers for some questions in <a href=\"http://ar-wp.com\">Arab WordPress</a> community, a forum to share knowledge among Arab WordPress users. This encouraged me to start a small freelancing business with WordPress. It seemed a great idea to expand expertise, earn some money, and follow my passion!</p>\n<h3>Fitting It All In</h3>\n<p>Being a freelancer and a high-school student at the same time was not that easy as one would think! Sometimes I was working until 3:00 a.m. to finish a client project, and then woke up at 6:30 a.m. rushing to school. Most often, classes were so dry that led me to write PHP codes in every copy-book of mine! If you would like to try this at your school, remember to move yourself to the end of your class or be ready for any of your teachers’ mean reactions to keep you attentive! On several afternoons, I used to take naps to restore my energy and be ready to work at night.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Very rarely, I would have to stay out at internet cafés until 2:00 a.m. to upload/download things I needed because we had no Internet connection at home.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For sure, this made my parents quite angry and obviously worried. Most importantly, I had neither a cell phone because of some strict rules in my family nor a national ID card because of the legal age requirement in Yemen. I was attempting to use my school ID card to receive money transactions, and guess what? I was lucky enough to manage it twice. But then I was asked to present a national ID. “ When will I turn 18?” I just had to overcome that obstacle, asking trustworthy friends to help.</p>\n<p>My clients were mostly from the Arab World, Europe, and USA. I had the chance to contact with many nice and outstanding people who not only boosted my experience but also showed me the way into some new opportunities and more success.</p>\n<h3>Support At Home</h3>\n<p>At the beginning, most of my family members thought I was playing, except my MOTHER. I remember the moment I told her about my fairly new business. She said, &#8220;Regardless of what it is, just do what you love and believe in!&#8221; However, I faced hard times trying to convince her I did not smoke as she smelled cigarette on my clothes whenever I got back home from those cafés! On the other hand, my father was the kind of man who stood backstage. He used to tell his friends how happy and proud he was of me. That was all what I needed from him.</p>\n<h3>Giving Back</h3>\n<p>On August 2012, I sent a message to Rasheed Bydousi, Arab WordPress community founder and translation editor of Arabic language, to suggest some ideas and ask to be a volunteer. He was very supportive and truly wise. We started discussing and working on some ideas for more than <a href=\"http://www.ar-wp.com/forums/topic/2119/\">4 months</a>. In parallel with studying, working, and being a volunteer, I increased my efforts in translating, patching (helping in development), and reporting bugs for WordPress projects.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was very important for me to give back to the community I had taken a lot from.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I felt the need of holding a WordPress meeting in my hometown, Taiz, because of the lack of specialized people who would like to collaborate and share knowledge. In 2013, I invited local developers to a small meeting in a local coffeeshop called “AL-Rassef”.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1894 size-full\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wp-meeting-alraseef-coffeshop.jpg\" alt=\"WordPress Meeting in Taiz, Yemen\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /></p>\n<p>Afterward, I presented a lecture about WordPress at Taiz University, in the same lecture hall I used to be a student in by that time. It was a warm beginning but I couldn&#8217;t continue due to my work and the deterioration of the political and security situation.</p>\n<h3>Disruption</h3>\n<p>Since 2011, my country has been facing major political changes and instability. On April 2015, the Yemeni crisis has reached its climax and war started in my city, Taiz, and it is still going on! Some of my relatives had decided to move out of Taiz but my father chose to stay, hoping that war will stop quickly. We lived for months without public electricity or Internet. When the fight crawled to our area, we lived for weeks in the ground floor of our house, no way to go out, tanks firing from 300 meters away, airstrikes on nearby areas, and snipers shooting whoever dared to walk on streets. Many friends and innocent people were killed and some members of my family were hurt. We couldn&#8217;t sleep for days, fearing that at any moment they will knock our house door.</p>\n<p>I thought that was the end for me and all of my dreams. I was pretending to be cool and calm so my younger brother and two sisters feel better. I was telling jokes, reading books or watching movies when we got some power from my uncle generator. &#8220;Life of Pi&#8221; was one of the movies we had watched and everyone enjoyed it! I refused to hold a gun, &#8220;How could it help?! That&#8217;s not my role in life!&#8221; I was thinking.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was struggling to believe in tomorrow, no matter how it looked miserable and sad.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In one of the mornings, after a nearby airstrike, we got a chance to escape. I tried to hold every detail of our house, neighborhood and street. &#8220;Thank you for all great memories. I will definitely return,&#8221; I told my house, feeling torn apart back then! I only took my laptop, tablet, and few clothes, they were all what I needed to start over.</p>\n<h3>Starting Over</h3>\n<blockquote><p>“You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.”<br />\n— Steve Jobs</p></blockquote>\n<p>After some time of catching my breath, I realized that I had to connect the dots, keep on following my dreams and aim higher. On May 2016, I moved to Sana&#8217;a, the capital city of Yemen, leaving the pain and frustration behind. I got to know some enthusiastic developers and we decided to establish a community called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ydevclub/\">Yemeni Developers Club</a> for people who are interested in computer programming and have the passion for it. We hold a meeting on the first Saturday of every month to share ideas, answer questions, and help one another to innovate, learn, and grow. We are planning to have, in the near future, special meetings to discuss WordPress related topics and learn how to obtain the maximum benefit from it.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-1895 size-full\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/taiz_and_sanaa_poster.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"420\" />Photos for Ta&#8217;izz and Sana&#8217;a cites, photographed by Mona Athubhani.\n<h3>Amazing Melting Pot</h3>\n<div class=\"_h8t\">\n<div id=\"js_jl2\" class=\"_5wd9 direction_rtl\">\n<div class=\"_5wde _n4o\">\n<div class=\"_5w1r _3_om _5wdf\">\n<div class=\"_4gx_\">\n<div class=\"_d97\"><span class=\"_5yl5\">I am sure that WordPress helps thousands of developers, including me, be more independent, involves them to be parts of it, and offers opportunities to serve people from around the world.</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress is such an amazing melting pot that contains people from everywhere, no matter how old they are, where they are from, or what languages they speak.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Become a Hero</h3>\n<p>Being a WordPress hero is not about programming skills or contributions size, it is all about the challenges we face and overcome.

At the click of a button, users can undo an action and restore a site&#8217;s database to a previous point in history without having to export and import MySQL.</p>\n<p>Borek Bernard, co-founder of VersionPress, says the move is the result of trying to overcome two major challenges: WordPress plugins and Hosts. WordPress plugins can alter a site&#8217;s database. Building <a href=\"https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/blob/master/docs/Plugin-Support.md\">in support</a> for the 40K+ plugins that exist in the repository has been a huge undertaking for the team.</p>\n<p>In order to use VersionPress, a webhost needs to have <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\">Git</a> installed and allow proc_open which it uses to interact with Git. Most hosts do not allow proc_open for security reasons or have older versions of Git installed, generating incompatibilities. &#8220;Over time, it became clear we needed our own environment to run VersionPress in,&#8221; Bernard said.</p>\n<p>All sites hosted on the platform run PHP 7 or Nginx, HTTP/2, and at least two Docker instances that auto-scale based on load. VersionPress.com includes the ability to set up staging and production sites using VersionPress&#8217; capabilities to merge changes between the two. Similar to <a href=\"https://getflywheel.com/why-flywheel/client-billing-transfer/\">Flywheel</a>, billing can be assigned to a developer, agency, or client account. &#8220;The platform is geared towards WordPress developers and agencies but will help anyone who wants a fast, reliable WordPress site,&#8221; Bernard said.</p>\n<p>The model they&#8217;re using is similar to WordPress.com and self-hosted WordPress. &#8220;A hosted service will provide resources to fund the development of the open source project and its long-term stability,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So it became a no-brainer at some point.&#8221; General availability for VersionPress.com won&#8217;t open until July but those who <a href=\"https://preview.versionpress.com/#preorder\">pre-order</a> will receive a substantial discount.</p>\n<p>Bernard re-iterated that VersionPress will always be a free, open source project and that VersionPress.com is a major step towards bringing full version control of WordPress to the masses.</p>\n<p>The managed WordPress hosting space is well established and perhaps a bit crowded. It will be interesting to see how VersionPress.com compares to and fits in with the competition.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 06 Jun 2017 21:45:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"Matt: Remote Work Can’t Be Stopped\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=47433\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"https://ma.tt/2017/06/remote-work-cant-be-stopped/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:489:\"<p>Christopher Mims writes for the Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-remote-work-cant-be-stopped-1496577602?mg=prod/accounts-wsj\">Why Remote Work Can&#8217;t Be Stopped</a>, also riffing off the <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/05/ibm-goes-non-remote/\">IBM shift I wrote about a few weeks ago</a>.

Balkhi said the plugin will become the company&#8217;s go-to recommendation on WPForms as well as WPBeginner.</p>\n<p>Email deliverability is a common problem for all types of WordPress websites, but it is the most frequent support issue for those using WPForms.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The number is only growing as Gmail, Yahoo, and others implement aggressive filters to reduce spam,&#8221; Balkhi said. &#8220;These spam filters look to see whether an email is originating from the location it claims to be originating from. This causes the emails sent from your WordPress site to either go in the spam folder or sometimes not be delivered at all! Having a proper SMTP solution significantly increases email deliverability. I believe that once we implement the new UX and workflow, this will significantly reduce our support load since this is the #1 issue our users deal with.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After a few months of email exchanges, Balkhi and Callum MacDonald reached an agreement for WPForms to purchase WP Mail SMTP. Balkhi would not disclose the exact financial details of the acquisition but said it was &#8220;a five-figure-deal because the plugin itself did not generate any revenue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>MacDonald had considered monetizing the plugin in the past but saw too many hurdles as he became less active in the WordPress space over the past few years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are a few recent developments around SMTP that mean the plugin could use an update,&#8221; MacDonald said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have the time, so it made sense to move on at this point. I went over [monetizing] it several times. My conclusion is that it&#8217;s a lot harder than it looks. If I was still active in the WordPress space, it would make more sense, but I&#8217;m not, so monetizing was going to be a long road and hard work. It made more sense to sell.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Balkhi said he approached MacDonald because email deliverability was a problem that he was looking to solve for WPForms users as well as the larger WPBeginner and WordPress community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t want to build an add-on for WPForms because the problem isn&#8217;t unique to just us,&#8221; Balkhi said. &#8220;It affects every form plugin and basically every WordPress website that sends an email of any kind (forgot password, user registration, etc).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Last year Balkhi and his team acquired <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/syed-balkhi-acquires-google-analytics-by-yoast-renames-to-monsterinsights\" target=\"_blank\">Yoast&#8217;s Google Analytics and renamed it to MonsterInsights</a>. Over the past year the plugin has continued its growth from 10 million downloads at the time of acquisition to more than 16 million today.</p>\n<p>Balkhi reports that the MonsterInsights acquisition has been a success but the product was a very different type of acquisition from the one announced today. He said he has no plans to build an email deliverability service but rather wants to invest in a solution that will help his customers and others in the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP plugin users can expect improvements to the plugin and a more &#8220;beginner-friendly&#8221; redesign, which Balkhi anticipates to release at the end of Q3 or Q4 of 2017.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In terms of growing our WPForms&#8217; user base through WP Mail SMTP, that&#8217;s not our primary goal,&#8221; Balkhi said. &#8220;Our top priority is to solve the email deliverability issue that our existing users and the larger WordPress community faces.&#8221; Balkhi said he hopes to leverage the 600,000+ user base to negotiate better deals with established email deliverability services.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 06 Jun 2017 20:12:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"WPTavern: Cory Miller and Dr. Sherry Walling Launch ZenTribes an Entrepreneur Peer Group\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=71006\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"https://wptavern.com/cory-miller-and-dr-sherry-walling-launch-zentribes-an-entrepreneur-peer-group\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3202:\"<p>Being an entrepreneur can be stressful, emotional, and lonely, especially during a rough part of life. Cory Miller, founder of <a href=\"https://ithemes.com/\">iThemes</a>, has been at the forefront of <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/12/10/cory-miller-managing-your-iceberg/\">advocating</a> that entrepreneurs don&#8217;t have to go through the struggles of running a business alone.</p>\n<p>Two years after founding iThemes, Miller found himself going through a tough divorce at the same time his company started taking off.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Not many people in my life at that time could come close to relating to what I was going through as a human combined with being an entrepreneur,&#8221; Miller said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was suffering in solitude. And I was craving authentic relationships with like-minded people on a similar path who knew what living the entrepreneurial life — with its sometimes drastic ups and downs — meant and who were walking it every day, like me, and wanted to walk together with others too.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Miller eventually found himself in an <a href=\"http://corymiller.com/find-belonging-support-entrepreneurial-peer-group/\">entrepreneur peer group</a> in Oklahoma City, OK, where entrepreneurs meet once a month for three hours to discuss the trials and tribulations of running a business.</p>\n<p>Miller says the group is partially responsible for his good health and happiness as a business owner, father, husband, and human being.</p>\n<p>In an effort to create similar opportunities for other business owners, Miller has partnered with <a href=\"http://www.sherrywalling.com/\">Dr. Sherry Walling</a>, who has a PhD in Psychology, to launch <a href=\"http://zenfounder.com/zentribes/\">ZenTribes</a>.</p>\n<p>ZenTribes is a group of 6-9 like-minded entrepreneurs that get together once a month online to share stories, encouragement, and express support for one another. Walling and Miller are both members of the group and will be sharing their expertise with members.</p>\n<p>Meetings will take place every Wednesday from 1-2:30 PM Central Standard Time for eight weeks using <a href=\"https://zoom.us/\">Zoom</a>. The first meeting is on July 12th. The last meeting is on August 30th.</p>\n<p>The first 15 minutes of meetings will focus on a key topic with an hour set aside for discussions and sharing experiences related to that topic. The last 15 minutes are dedicated to sharing resources and giving attendees suggested homework.</p>\n<p>Some of the topics that will be discussed include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Burnout</li>\n<li>Depression</li>\n<li>Conflict</li>\n<li>Failure and loss</li>\n<li>Loneliness and friendship</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ZenTribes is <a href=\"http://zenfounder.com/zentribes/apply/\">accepting applications</a> for the first group of people until 1 PM CST June 15th. The cost to be a member of the group is $799.

As the core team has more collective knowledge of working with React, they have reached out to developers with different experiences of using other frameworks in a  WordPress context.</p>\n<p>One of the chief concerns contributors have regarding Vue is the longevity of the project. I asked Vue creator <a href=\"http://evanyou.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Evan You</a> if he could weigh in on the topic to give WordPress contributors a better understanding of the project, specifically regarding his efforts to cultivate additional maintainers to help share the load of maintainership.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s important to look at the track record &#8211; Vue has been around for almost 4 years, and all the work has been done in public on GitHub so anyone can go and check the maintenance history,&#8221; You said. &#8220;While it has been largely developed by me, the current maintenance is a lot more community-driven. We have active core team members triaging most of the issues and a larger and larger percentage of the issues fixed by community PRs. So &#8211; yes, I had already been working on cultivating additional maintainers and will continue to do so.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You currently receives <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/evanyou\" target=\"_blank\">$10K/month from recurring Patreon donations</a> that fund his full-time efforts working on Vue. Prior to this he also worked at Google and Meteor. During his time at Google, some of the projects You worked on used Angular, which he said he found to be too heavy for his use cases at the time. He built Vue.js to be a more lightweight implementation of the concepts that he liked about Angular.</p>\n<p>You also recently said he has learned quite a bit from the React community, which has influenced some of his technical decisions in Vue 2.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I learned a lot from the React community &#8211; on both code and people. I hope everyone can be like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dan_abramov\">@dan_abramov</a>. Peace.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Evan You (@youyuxi) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/869020366705799168\">May 29, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#8220;First, Vue 2 uses the same Virtual DOM based rendering model underneath, which was first pioneered by React,&#8221; You said. &#8220;Introducing a Virtual DOM allowed Vue to expose the power of vdom composition while maintaining the approachability.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The React community is also very active when there are new problem domains being explored &#8211; e.g. state management and CSS management. There are many competing solutions and a lot of inspirations when I was implementing official solutions for Vue.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Evan You Addresses WordPress Core Contributors&#8217; Misconceptions about Vue.js</h3>\n<p>You said he has been following WordPress contributors&#8217; discussions on React vs Vue but would not offer an opinion on which is a better choice for the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My answer would obviously be biased, and honestly I&#8217;m not in the shoes of the WP core team so I don&#8217;t have enough perspective to make a choice,&#8221; You said. &#8220;However, I can provide feedback on some of the issues being discussed in hope of helping them make a better-informed decision.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You left a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/31/javascript-chat-summary-for-may-30th/#comment-32642\" target=\"_blank\">comment</a> on the most recent Javascript meeting notes with clarifications on a few misunderstandings about Vue.js. You addressed the point regarding &#8220;embracing JavaScript the language,&#8221; as some contributors think Vue&#8217;s templating language obscures the underlying JavaScript.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think &#8217;embracing JavaScript the language&#8217; is another primitive of React we don’t see in Vue,&#8221; Andrew Duthie <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1496150274570299\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> during the last meeting.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;s reply compares Vue&#8217;s use of templates as &#8220;syntax sugar for view representation on top of HTML&#8221; to what he believes to be a similar usage in the case of JSX as view representation on top of JavaScript:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The increasing richness of UI does NOT necessitate putting everything in JavaScript. On the other hand, just because Vue uses templates by default doesn’t mean it allows people to get by without learning JavaScript properly.</p>\n<p>Vue’s templates are compiled into JavaScript render functions under the hood and they are actually closer to JavaScript than to traditional string templating. It’s just a layer of syntax sugar on top of the underlying Virtual DOM representation. Think of JSX as syntax sugar for view representation on top of JS; Vue templates are syntax sugar for view representation on top of HTML.</p>\n<p>JSX/Raw JS does provide more flexibility when you need to apply direct manipulation of Virtual DOM nodes, this is why Vue also supports render functions. But this is not putting two opposing paradigms under the same tent – it’s simply allowing the user to skip the syntax sugar layer for more control.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You said the idea behind templating on top of render functions is to provide &#8220;better approachability,&#8221; a concern shared by many other proponents of WordPress adopting Vue.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Users who are more comfortable with HTML and have simpler use cases could use the template, while users who are already familiar of JSX/render functions can leverage the full power of JS,&#8221; You said. &#8220;This would fit pretty nicely for the use of WP core: community users who care about approachability have an easier time getting started, while the core team have access to JSX/render functions for advanced use cases.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You also addressed the concern of longevity by offering more information on Vue&#8217;s development processes. He confirmed that the current codebase is largely developed by him alone, but maintenance is spread across a core team with members all over the world.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Other contributors have lower commit counts because their contributions are all submitted in the form of PRs and we use the &#8216;Squash and commit&#8217; feature on GitHub so each PR results in only one commit for the contributor,&#8221; You said. &#8220;We’ve merged close to 500 PRs in the core repo alone, and many more across the organization. Other repos under the vuejs organization, e.g. vuex, vue-router, vuejs.org are also largely maintained by dedicated team members.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You also offered clarification on questions of stability and future compatibility, as WordPress contributors presented concerns regarding breaking changes in the templating language in Vue 2.0.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This begs for some clarification: Vue versioning strictly follows semver,&#8221; You said. &#8220;The only time there had been breaking API changes post 1.0 was the 2.0 bump. The template syntax is part of the API so it’s not going to [break], and in between major version bumps we commit to 100% API backwards compatibility.

Ed Finkler, who founded OSMI in 2013, left his position as CTO of <a href=\"https://www.graphstory.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Graph Story</a> to work full-time on speaking, educating, and providing resources to support mental wellness in the tech and open source communities. As of today, the campaign has raised more than $58,000.</p>\n<p>In addition to donations from individuals, OSMI has added several corporate sponsors, including CakeDC, Github, Digital Ocean, and Laravel. CakeDC has designated $1,000/month for 12 months to support Finkler&#8217;s salary. Finkler works together with a board of directors and a team of volunteers who also speak at conferences about mental health in tech. Several WordPress companies have also been involved in raising support for OSMI, including <a href=\"https://www.youcaring.com/opensourcingmentalillness-704978\" target=\"_blank\">WebDevStudios</a> and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-elevation-is-focusing-all-content-on-mental-health-for-month-of-may\" target=\"_blank\">WP Elevation</a>.</p>\n<p>OSMI conducts an annual Mental Health in Tech survey as part of ongoing research. Last year&#8217;s survey received more than 1,500 responses and the results underscore the great need for removing the stigma surrounding mental illness in the tech industry. A few examples Finkler highlighted include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Respondents believe it&#8217;s 6 times more likely that discussing a mental health issue with their employer would have a negative consequence, vs a physical health issue.</li>\n<li>Respondents are 3.5 times less likely to bring up a mental health issue in an interview than a physical health issue.</li>\n<li>87% believe being identified as a person with a mental health issue would hurt their career.</li>\n<li>Only 30% of respondents&#8217; employers provide information about mental health and how to seek help.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>OSMI offers all of the resources it creates for free. The funds raised in the campaign will help to create more tools, documents, videos, and other educational resources. Finkler is working towards engaging with more HR departments and educating more executive teams. He also plans to use the funds to do more research and employ additional experts to reach more people.</p>\n<p>For more information about OSMI&#8217;s efforts to improve mental health in the tech industry, check out Jeff Chandler&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-273-mental-health-awareness-with-bridget-willard-and-ed-finkler\" target=\"_blank\">recent interview with Finkler on the WP Weekly podcast</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 03 Jun 2017 03:59:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"WPTavern: In Case You Missed It – Issue 21\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=71142&preview=true&preview_id=71142\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"https://wptavern.com/in-case-you-missed-it-issue-21\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6022:\"<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ICYMIFeaturedImage.png?ssl=1\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-50955\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/112901923@N07/16153818039\">Night Moves</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p>There’s a lot of great WordPress content published in the community but not all of it is featured on the Tavern.

Brian Gardner was able to create a profitable business with a single magazine style theme called Revolution, one of the first themes to display content in ways different from the typical single column blog layout.</p>\n<p>Magazine themes are a great chapter of WordPress&#8217; history. Their popularity is why WordPress has featured images and automatic thumbnail generation in core.</p>\n<h2>Highlights From Season Four of ManageWP&#8217;s Ask Me Anything</h2>\n<p>ManageWP <a href=\"https://managewp.com/ama-season-4-highlights\">published highlights</a> from season four of Ask Me Anything, a weekly event where members of the WordPress community voluntarily answer any questions submitted.</p>\n<h2>WordPress 4.8 Field Guide</h2>\n<p>Everything you need to know to prepare for WordPress 4.8, tentatively scheduled for release on June 8th, is in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/wordpress-4-8-field-guide/\">the field guide</a>.</p>\n<h2>Take the WPCampus WordPress in Higher Education Survey</h2>\n<p>WPCampus is once again asking for those who work with WordPress in educational settings to fill out the <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/wpcampus17\">following survey</a>. This year, three randomly selected participants will receive a free ticket to attend WPCampus in Buffalo, NY, July 14-15.</p>\n<p>The data will be used to create a series of reports on how WordPress is used in public schools and higher education. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wpcampus-survey-results-indicate-misconceptions-of-wordpress-are-slowing-its-growth-in-higher-education\">Last year&#8217;s survey</a> indicated that misconceptions surrounding WordPress security and scalability are slowing its growth in higher education.</p>\n<h2>A Plugin for Monitoring Directory Sizes</h2>\n<p>David Bisset shared a dashboard widget that displays the sizes of directories.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WordPress dashboard widget that displays directory sizes, in case you need to keep an eye on that for some reason. <a href=\"https://t.co/eWu6cxtze7\">https://t.co/eWu6cxtze7</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/bPOgXVkwvL\">pic.twitter.com/bPOgXVkwvL</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; David Bisset (@dimensionmedia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia/status/870081713036181504\">June 1, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Stop Signup Spam Integrates with GiveWP</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/stop-signup-spam/\">Stop Signup Spam</a>, a plugin we <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-plugin-blocks-spam-user-registrations-using-stop-forum-spam-database\">featured last month</a> now integrates with GiveWP.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My \"Stop Signup Spam\" plugin now integrates with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GiveWP\">@GiveWP</a>, thanks to a contribution from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/learnwithmattc\">@learnwithmattc</a>! <a href=\"https://t.co/hmHBxxKEki\">https://t.co/hmHBxxKEki</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Leland Fiegel (@lelandf) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lelandf/status/869976727912579073\">May 31, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>LED WordPress Badge</h2>\n<p>George Stephanis unveiled his wifi-enabled light up WordPress badge on Twitter.

The new desktop app is in early beta at version 0.2.0 with version 1.0.0 coming soon.</p>\n<p>Chassis Desktop was designed with a user-friendly interface suitable for beginners and experts alike. It was built by Bronson Quick and Ryan McCue using <a href=\"http://electron.atom.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Electron</a> and contains code from the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app\" target=\"_blank\">create-react-app</a> project.</p>\n<p>On first launch the app makes sure that Vagrant and VirtualBox are installed and then guides the user to create a new box. Setting up a new Chassis install or adding Chassis to an existing install is fast and easy with the simple UI. The app also includes keyboard navigation and a built-in terminal for quick access to more control over your box.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/add-new-box.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Over the years Chassis contributors have created an ecosystem of <a href=\"http://beta.chassis.io/extensions/\" target=\"_blank\">extensions</a> for things like MailHog, Photon, Memcache, debugging, and other software. These add-ons allow users to tailor their systems to their needs.</p>\n<p>Chassis Desktop aims to make it easy for users to manager their Chassis development environments without having to touch the command line. As it is currently in pre-release status, early adopters may discover some bugs.

Here are a few examples of WordPress data it can log:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log any failed logins</li>\n<li>Keep track of all WordPress cron requests</li>\n<li>Intercept the WordPress-specific exit function, wp_die(), and log any (direct or indirect) usage</li>\n<li>PHP core notices, warnings and (fatal) errors, uncaught exceptions (as well as PHP 7+ Throwable)</li>\n<li>WordPress core errors such as database errors, HTTP API errors, wp_mail() errors, and 404 errors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wonolog is available as a Composer package and its creators recommend installing at the website level. Inpsyde has been using it successfully in production with different projects for several months. Wonolog requires PHP 5.6 or higher and WordPress 4.6+.

This is the second release since the project was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-cli-gets-official-wordpress-org-support\" target=\"_blank\">brought under the official WordPress umbrella</a> and the first major release since <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-cli-names-alain-schlesser-new-co-maintainer\" target=\"_blank\">hiring Alain Schlesser as a part-time co-maintainer</a>.</p>\n<p>Splitting WP-CLI&#8217;s internal commands into separate packages moves the project closer to the goal of having official maintainers for the commands in the future. This new structure for the framework and its commands provides several benefits, as outlined by co-maintainer Daniel Bachhuber in the release post:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While developing, the tests are only run for the specific component you’re working on, making the feedback loop much shorter.</li>\n<li>Individual command packages can be controlled and set up independently, opening up the opportunity for better collaboration.</li>\n<li>Hotfixes and intermediary releases can be published for individual commands, that can then be updated through the built-in package manager.</li>\n<li>Tests run really fast now.</li>\n<li>When you submit a pull request, you don’t have to wait two hours for the tests to run.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This release also includes three new commands, along with dozens of command improvements and framework enhancements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>wp config get</code> lists constants and globals defined in wp-config.php</li>\n<li><code>wp config path</code> gets the path to wp-config.php</li>\n<li><code>wp db size</code> gets the size of the database and its tables</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Version 1.2.0 had 43 contributors, a 95% increase in contributors from the previous release. One of the next priorities for maintainers is to improve the contribution workflow. Bachhuber said there are no plans at the moment to bring on additional paid co-maintainers, but they plan to start onboarding more volunteer committers. These are developers who are involved with the project on a regular basis but not necessarily daily or weekly. They have also created a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/good-first-issues/\" target=\"_blank\">Good First Issues page</a> for new contributors and have started working on a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/dash/\" target=\"_blank\">customized dashboard for committers</a>.</p>\n<h3>WP-CLI Has a New Logo</h3>\n<p>Bachhuber introduced the project&#8217;s new logo today, designed by Chris Wallace and his team at <a href=\"https://liftux.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lift UX</a>. Having an official logo opens up the possibility for WP-CLI swag. Bachhuber said he worked with contributors to create a logo, because &#8220;people can develop stronger emotional affinity to brands with logos (myself included).&#8221; He is also interested in getting stickers created, particularly ones that glow in the dark, but has not yet found a producer. Bachhuber said he is hoping to have some preliminary WP-CLI swag for WordCamp Europe.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 01 Jun 2017 00:17:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"WPTavern: Pods 2.7 Beta Introduces Flexible Relationships, Rewrites Fields in JavaScript\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=71009\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"https://wptavern.com/pods-2-7-beta-introduces-flexible-relationships-rewrites-fields-in-javascript\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2272:\"<p>Pods Framework has released two new versions. <a href=\"http://pods.io/2017/05/30/pods-2-6-9-maintenance-release/\">Pods 2.6.9</a> is a maintenance release that includes bug fixes for Pods Templates, Auto Templates, and Pods Shortcodes.

The feature was introduced this week as a way for project maintainers to manage participation in heated discussions.</p>\n<p>Public repositories, especially those for projects with millions of users, can occasionally have issues or pull requests that become overrun with comments from anyone who has an opinion. Repository owners can now set a 24-hour &#8220;cool down period&#8221; to limit interaction (commenting, creating pull requests, and opening issues) to existing users, prior contributors, and/or repository collaborators.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/temporary-interaction-limits.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Temporary Interaction Limits can help mitigate the effects of &#8220;brigading,&#8221; <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14447705\" target=\"_blank\">as one Hacker News commenter called it</a> &#8211; when someone directs a large number of people to an issue from Twitter, Reddit, or other social channels in an attempt to influence the outcome of a discussion. Limiting the discussion to prior contributors or collaborators can help keep input focused around the ideas of those who are already invested in the project.</p>\n<p>Reactions to the new feature have been mostly positive, although some users don&#8217;t anticipate using it much since <a href=\"https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub added emoji reactions to conversations</a> last year. In addition to keeping threads from becoming unreadable with numerous +1&#8217;s, emoji reactions as an option for expression should help limit interactions from those prone to &#8220;drive-by&#8221; commenting.</p>\n<p>A curated repository of &#8220;<a href=\"https://github.com/nikolas/github-drama\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub Drama</a>,&#8221; which includes projects like Bower, Docker, Django, and NodeJS, lists many instances wherein temporarily limiting interaction may have changed the overall tone of the discourse. However, some users questioned the feature&#8217;s usefulness in responses on Twitter and some see it as a way of purposely cutting outside voices out of the conversation.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So many of us are curious: when would we use this?

Some users have also requested a convenient way for repository members to warn an individual without spamming the entire thread or to put specific users in a cool down period.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s a legit heated discussion and you limit it, then you&#8217;re just [going] to come back in 24 hours to very long, impossible-to-follow responses,&#8221; Kris Siegel, Senior Engineer at PlayStation, <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14448871\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on the related Hacker News thread. &#8220;At least this has been my experience when people have left things to cool down them come back and need to respond to everything.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GitHub is aiming to promote healthier discussions with the new interaction limiting feature, but every project&#8217;s community is unique and maintainers may not be able to predict user reactions to locking down an entire repository. If the feature is turned on when a new user is attempting to create their first pull request, it may hinder future contribution.  Open source project maintainers should carefully consider the effects of silencing non-contributors when using the feature.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 31 May 2017 20:35:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"HeroPress: Building A WordPress Career in India\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1874\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:136:\"https://heropress.com/essays/building-wordpress-career-india/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=building-wordpress-career-india\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10706:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/053117-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: Give your children the room to grow.\" /><p>6 years back, I’d have never thought I would be where I am right now. At that time, I was a 12-year-old wondering how softwares were made. Despite the fact that I was born in a middle-class Indian family, my parents never forced me to opt for something I wasn’t interested in. Unlike other middle-class Indian children, the bar of expectations wasn’t set that high and I think it turned out to be for the best.</p>\n<p>My parents always supported me and constantly motivated me to learn whatever I liked. Eventually, from wondering about how software was made, I started wondering same about websites. For some reason, I felt more interested in websites than software. For starters, I felt coding in HTML was easier than working with C/C++</p>\n<p>Now that I’ve bored you already, let’s get to know each other too. I am <a href=\"http://technobooz.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Suyogya Shukla</a>, a WordPress developer from Kanpur, India. I work with <a href=\"https://themeisle.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ThemeIsle</a> as a Support Ninja where I make sure our users are always happy with our products. Let’s go ahead now.</p>\n<h3>The Journey</h3>\n<p>At the age of 12; still in class 6th, I started to learn about web coding. I started with HTML and learned how to make a really basic webpage. After understanding the basic concepts I wanted to start making a website already. I went ahead and googled &#8211; “How to make a free website” and the webs.com&#8217;s listing lead the page. I immediately clicked on it and started playing around, until I realized that it was WYSIWYG editor and it wasn’t possible for me to customize it a lot (Not that I knew how to!)</p>\n<p>At this time I had no idea about domain names and hosting. I researched some more and was introduced to the process of putting your website online, but it cost money! I decided to make a small website locally and then show it to my dad hoping he’d be impressed and provide me with the money I needed to put it online. While learning HTML, I came across this cool language called  “CSS” which would apparently make a website look and work better.</p>\n<p>Next thing you know, I was all over w3schools.com and YouTube watching videos about CSS, playing with the examples and much more. It took me a good 2 weeks to understand the basic concepts. I could finally change fonts, play with colors and do a lot more! While I liked how I had more control when I coded my own website, I still missed the easy content management webs.com and other WYSIWYG tools offered. This had me thinking again. What free software can I use to have the same level of control over my website but is just as easy to use when it comes to content management? This, in turn, initiated another research and I was finally introduced to this awesome software which went by the name of “WordPress”!</p>\n<p>Over the years I would work on a lot of WordPress based websites and continue to learn more about it every day. I worked for various small design agencies, as a freelancer and a lot more until one fine day in 2016 when I saw a “hiring” notice on <a href=\"https://themeisle.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ThemeIsle&#8217;s</a> website and decided to give it a shot. After an initial trial period of some 2 weeks, I was hired. I worked part-time (three hours/day, to be exact) for a year because I had school. Two months back, I started working full time. I work with the support and development team (more involved in support as of now, but I eventually want to get into full-time development) where I continue to learn new things every day.</p>\n<h3>It’s a Real Career Option!</h3>\n<p>For everyone who thinks WordPress is just a blogging tool, you’re wrong! Sure, it’s a blogging tool but it is used for so much more. It’s a real career option with a lot of room for growth. Given you are passionate about WordPress and the technologies used in it, you’d be able to find a job easily.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The best thing about the WordPress ecosystem is the people. They’re just so nice!</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress ecosystem is indeed competitive like any other but in the best way possible. Even if you’re another company wanting to know how some other company manages things or what technologies they use, they won’t hesitate to tell you about it. Almost all of the WordPress enthusiasts go to WordCamps where they meet new people and share knowledge.</p>\n<p>Another good thing about choosing WordPress as a career? The flexibility. A large part of the people who work on WordPress, do it remotely. The company WordPress.com, Automattic, is a completely distributed team with people working from different parts of the world. Want even more reasons to choose WordPress? The earning potential. Companies in the WordPress ecosystem are known to pay generously and the best part? You get to work with the folks who are just as passionate about WordPress as you are.</p>\n<h3>Engineering isn’t the only way to go</h3>\n<p>This is for all the Indian parents who are pushing their children to join coachings for IIT and other examinations right now, without their children wanting to &#8211; DON’T. Engineering isn’t the only way one can get a job. Sure, there’s nothing wrong with it but forcing your children to do it because you think there’s no other way? That isn’t right.</p>\n<p>Introduce your children to WordPress, introduce them to the world of web programming and see if they like it. Why not promote them to do something they like than to burden them with the weight of engineering when they don’t like it?</p>\n<blockquote><p>For all I know if my parents had forced me into engineering I would’ve missed out on everything. Give your children the room to grow.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Make them learn new things, introduce them to WordPress and all other cool things ( not just tech related! ) and leave it up to them to choose a career path <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<h3>Working Remotely Is Fun</h3>\n<p>Let’s talk about working remotely now. It’s fun. You don’t have to wear a suit or any kind of uniform. You get to work in your PJs. Does it get any better than that? Oh wait, it does. You get to choose your working hours. You can decide to work 3hrs in morning and 3hrs at night or you can work 6hours at a stretch. Fellow night crawler? You can work at night. Apart from that, it gives you a lot of freedom. You can work from wherever you want. You can go to a beach and work. You can work while traveling, basically, you can decide to work from anywhere, anytime! It’s all up to you.</p>\n<p>Flexible working hours allow me to concentrate on learning new things on a personal level and maintain a healthy Work/ Life balance. But over time, you might get bored working from home. ( Not sure about you but it did happen with me! )</p>\n<blockquote><p>My two cents? Take some time out and go vacationing.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Join a co-working space and see if that helps. All in all, I love having the freedom to work from anywhere and the best part still remains that I can work while wearing my PJs.</p>\n<h3>What’s Next?</h3>\n<p>Let me put it this way; I love WordPress. I have been doing some UI/UX work for a while now and I liked it. I am planning to learn more about it while learning more about WordPress development in parallel. For now, I am starting a small WordPress studio, <a href=\"http://madewithwp.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Made With WP</a>, with my friends (and colleagues) &#8211; Hardeep and Rohit. <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/be-your-own-teacher/\">You might remember Hardeep talking about it in his essay</a>. It’s the same project. I am working on my first WordPress theme and hope to see it in the theme directory soon. I am pretty good with HTML, CSS and comfortable with JS and PHP and I plan to learn more about them.</p>\n<p>Apart from that, I am the co-organizer of <a href=\"https://2017.kanpur.wordcamp.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WordCamp Kanpur</a>. I have been to two WordCamps so far and run an active meetup in my hometown, Kanpur. I gave my 12th exams this year and I plan to study more about new things as much as I can. Also, I am 18 years old as I write this.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Building A WordPress Career in India\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Building%20A%20WordPress%20Career%20in%20India&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbuilding-wordpress-career-india%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Building A WordPress Career in India\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbuilding-wordpress-career-india%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbuilding-wordpress-career-india%2F&title=Building+A+WordPress+Career+in+India\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Building A WordPress Career in India\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/building-wordpress-career-india/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/053117-150x150.jpg&description=Building A WordPress Career in India\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Building A WordPress Career in India\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/building-wordpress-career-india/\" title=\"Building A WordPress Career in India\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/building-wordpress-career-india/\">Building A WordPress Career in India</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 31 May 2017 12:00:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Suyogya Shukla\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:110:\"WPTavern: WordPress Core JavaScript Framework Debate Heats Up, Contributors Narrow Discussion to React vs. Vue\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=70985\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:119:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-javascript-framework-debate-heats-up-contributors-narrow-discussion-to-react-vs-vue\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10702:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/lego.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: oskay <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/17425845@N00/2156889157\">Small Parts</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p>WordPress core contributors met this morning to continue the discussion on selecting a new JavaScript framework for use with new core features. The discussion on the Make/Core <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/24/javascript-chat-summary-for-may-23rd/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> intensified over the weekend with more Vue.js proponents commenting to add their thoughts.</p>\n<p>Adam Silverstein and Andrew Duthie facilitated this morning&#8217;s meeting and began by opening up the discussion to include other frameworks such as Preact, Angular, and Ember. However, the discussion quickly narrowed to React vs Vue.</p>\n<p>Silverstein encouraged participants to remember that the new framework is for use with new features such as the new editor and that they will continue to use Backbone when it is the right tool, as well as in existing JavaScript. He also emphasized that the discussion pertains to a framework for core and developers are free to use whatever framework they choose to build plugins or themes.</p>\n<h3>Vue.js Proponents Consider &#8220;Ease of Learning&#8221; an Important Factor in Selecting a New Framework</h3>\n<p>Ease of learning is not among the criteria contributors identified for selecting a new framework, but it is one of the major concerns for Vue.js proponents.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Vue can do everything that React can do and is much more approachable,&#8221; Justin Kopepasah said. &#8220;There is a huge adoption of Vue and growth does not show any signs of stopping. Some of the top open source frameworks have adopted Vue and it is used by the top three tech companies in China (including Alibaba). While I do agree that React is a good choice as well, it is not highly approachable by new developers and has Facebook behind it which can be very alarming for people in many ways (not just tech).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Justin Tadlock, a core contributor whose code and tutorials have assisted many developers learning WordPress, shared similar thoughts over the weekend on the Mare/Core post:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve tried React on a few occasions. Even with over 10 years of programming experience, it was tough to grok for me. I can’t imagine trying to learn it as someone new to WP development.</p>\n<p>Vue is dead simple to start learning. I had a small app up and going in minutes. In a couple of hours, I was building some cool, form-related stuff without the docs.</p>\n<p>If it were entirely up to me, I’d push for WP to build its own JS framework that solves the problems specific to WordPress. But, if we’re going to choose an existing framework, go with Vue.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Matias Ventura, an Automattic engineer and contributor on both the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso\" target=\"_blank\">Calypso</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg</a> projects, is a proponent of WordPress adopting React. He contends that considering which is easier to learn is the wrong focus for determining what WordPress&#8217; future interfaces will need.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In my opinion, instead of &#8216;easier to get started,&#8217; we need to look at robust programming paradigms and an expressive approach to coding interfaces,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;This is what I fundamentally take from Matt’s &#8216;learn JavaScript deeply&#8217; &#8211; the corollary being that WordPress becomes a platform for teaching JavaScript to new programmers, and we need to take that seriously, not just as a convenience to us in the short term.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ventura also noted that WordPress has historically not been successful in attracting JavaScript developers and the JS interfaces in core lack contributors when compared to the PHP side.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have an opportunity to make WordPress development more appealing to a newer generation of developers that learned how to code through JavaScript,&#8221; Ventura said. He encouraged other participants to examine the kinds of interfaces that WordPress needs to modernize and select the best framework for handling them in core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The &#8216;easier to get started&#8217; [argument] seems a bit fallacious to me,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;Easier to whom? At what cost to properly learning JavaScript? The demands of rich interfaces in web applications require a deeper understanding of the technologies used. That’s not something we can avoid. JavaScript cannot be seen as mere progressive enhancement anymore as it is the language in which modern interfaces are expressed.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Contributors are Concerned about React being Backed by Facebook</h3>\n<p>At the moment, React is more established and more widely adopted than Vue, but contributors are concerned about the framework being backed and licensed by Facebook. In addition to concerns over the interpretation of React&#8217;s additional <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-will-continue-to-use-react-js-in-calypso-despite-patent-clause\" target=\"_blank\">patent grant</a>, the company has been the source of numerous controversies regarding censorship, data mining, and privacy, among other issues. Opponents don&#8217;t want to see WordPress hitch its wagon to Facebook by using React in core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The adoption of React is much more than adding a library to WordPress: it is adding the culture, business practices, and code base led by a tech giant,&#8221; Justin Kopepasah <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/24/javascript-chat-summary-for-may-23rd/#comment-32557\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;If we include React in Core, in a way we are asking users (from single site owners to enterprise) to accept Facebook has a key role in the future of WordPress. I have little doubt this will cause pause for some companies considering to adopt WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, other contributors have concerns about Vue.js&#8217; longevity, because it&#8217;s so heavily dependent on its creator Evan You. You <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/evanyou\" target=\"_blank\">funds his efforts on Patreon</a> but the project doesn&#8217;t have any major corporate backing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m uncomfortable relying on a project run by a single person that could disappear,&#8221; React proponent and WP REST API co-lead Ryan McCue said. &#8220;Being run by a corporation with a stake in the game means long-term support and relative stability.&#8221; McCue also noted that React has a &#8220;a massive community of teaching and support out there for people learning.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Many Feel WordPress Selecting React as the New JS Framework is a Foregone Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Despite all the discussions in meetings and on Make/Core posts, many onlookers and community members are convinced that WordPress choosing React is a foregone conclusion. At the beginning of last week&#8217;s discussion it seemed that most core contributors are in favor of React, but a strong contingent of Vue proponents have turned out to add comments to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/24/javascript-chat-summary-for-may-23rd/\" target=\"_blank\">discussion</a>.</p>\n<p>Selecting React appears to be the only viable choice when the criteria from the beginning includes items like &#8220;proven in a WordPress context&#8221; and &#8220;alignment with Calypso.&#8221; Many have commented to say that the criteria is biased and they assume the decision was already made through the backchannels with a public discussion held for &#8220;optics.&#8221; Automattic engineer James Nylen <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/876\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> last week on an open ticket for the Gutenberg project, saying that &#8220;Per recent discussion in core Slack, WP core has basically decided to adopt React.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If this was truly meant to be a community discussion, then why is it taking place now?&#8221; WordPress developer Christopher A. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-to-select-new-javascript-framework-for-use-in-core#comment-221446\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on our recent post that summarized the initial discussion. &#8220;Choosing a view framework should have happened before the first line of Gutenberg was written. It was known from the start that a view framework would be needed. It was Matt’s desire to get it off the ground as quickly as possible. The best way to accomplish this was to utilize Automattic developers who have experience with React.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress is selecting a JavaScript framework at a time where frameworks are rapidly evolving, but contributors involved in the decision said they will preserve the ability for theme and plugin developers to use any framework they choose to build their products. No framework was selected during today&#8217;s meeting and Andrew Duthie said he expects the conversation will continue at WordCamp Europe&#8217;s contributor summit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As to React vs Vue (vs Angular vs …), we’ve been discussing the arguments for and against each in the weekly chat, and we’re intentionally taking it slow,&#8221; Ryan McCue said. &#8220;The key criteria that we’ve picked come from what the project needs, and are not intended to bias the decision in a specific direction. Calypso and other projects are a strong signal towards React, but they’re not the ultimate argument (if they were, we wouldn’t even be discussing it).&#8221;</p>\n<p>McCue said he doesn&#8217;t see WordPress replacing the whole admin with Calypso in a way that doesn&#8217;t allow developers to use whatever they choose for their own extensions. The decision to adopt a JavaScript framework for core is more for making core developers&#8217; work easier. At this time, core developers working on new features have a greater knowledge of React than other frameworks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, we need to make a decision on what to use in core, and that decision directly impacts the people working on core,&#8221; McCue said. &#8220;Picking one framework over another doesn’t mean the others are worse, it’s just us (as core contributors) trying to make our own development easier.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A summary of the discussion should be posted to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\" target=\"_blank\">Make/Core blog</a> soon and the discussion on selecting a new JavaScript framework will continue in future meetings.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 30 May 2017 23:15:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"BuddyPress: Building Bridges between Students and Educators in Nepal\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=266185\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://buddypress.org/2017/05/building-bridges-between-students-and-educators-in-nepal/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9319:\"<div><em>This is a guest post by Arjun Bhattarai (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/aju29\">aju29</a>), Founder and Developer of <a href=\"http://studentsnepal.com/\">StudentsNepal.com</a>.

The site helps students find answers to popular courses and colleges by acting as a bridge between the students and educators/educational organizations.</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>I started working on this side project in December 2014. I remembered I had very little information about courses and colleges I could choose from after finishing Higher Secondary level back in 2011. There were no websites that could readily help students to explore the various opportunities available in Nepal. There are still a lot of students in Nepal who have been brain-fed that studying abroad is the one and only option to be successful. My vision was to change this mindset among the young students of Nepal by informing them about the abundant opportunities and options available within the country.</p>\n<p>The goal for creating StudentsNepal is to increase communication among different students with different educational backgrounds while helping them to learn all sorts of information and get hold of educational resources. Communication and interaction are the core values of StudentsNepal and these are the features that help the platform stand out from rest of the educational websites. BuddyPress and bbPress have helped us to achieve these values in a cost effective and efficient way. The beauty of these plugins is that our members can create content and help to rank us higher with search engines.</p>\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\n<p>The investment to create StudentsNepal.com was very low, a fraction of my pocket money during my final years in college. It is now one of the top educational portals of Nepal. Since WordPress was so easy to master, my dev team and I were able to use most of our free time to create initial content and other valuable resources for our visitors &#8211; students, parents, and educators &#8211; rather than spending time/money coding from scratch or buying a proprietary platform.</p>\n<p>Before choosing BuddyPress, I researched open-source social network scripts and platforms. My shortlist included WordPress (BuddyPress), Joomla (JomSocial), and Drupal (social modules). It was clear to me, after reading a lot of support forum posts and articles, that the BuddyPress/WordPress combo was the way to move forward with my dream. I am really happy about this choice today. The other heavyweight plugins that I added were GravityForms, Sucuri, bbPress, and MyCred plus other smaller plugins for specific tasks.</p>\n<h2>Customizations &amp; Improvements</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Login and Registration Pages</strong><br />\nWe found out that the default login and registration pages made it difficult for members to log in and have kept site visitors from registering. We resolved the issues by installing the Gravity Forms plugin and adding log in integration via Facebook, Twitter, or Google+ as well as making the registration page more user-friendly.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-266188\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/studentsnepal-login.png\" alt=\"studentsnepal login screen\" width=\"1349\" height=\"673\" /></p>\n<p><strong>2. Newsletters</strong><br />\nI thought about adding a newsletter because I loved the way some of the blogs I subscribed to sent organized information and recent activities of the blog in a beautiful email format. I decided to add an optin form to start collecting names and emails 2 to 3 months after launching the site. During the first 6 months, only first names and emails were collected with the popup optin form. Later, I changed the optin forms to collect email addresses and phone numbers. I have been using the free package of mailmunch for optin forms (popups) and Amazon AWS for sending newsletters. The newsletter contains scholarship notices for different universities/colleges, student stories, youth events, and other useful academic information.</p>\n<p>The newsletters have become one of the most popular features for the community. We did a lot of testing for the positioning and timing of the popup to get the most sign ups. StudentsNepal had around 20,000 subscribers by the end of 2015. The number of subscribers started growing after I inserted the forms in all the subdomains. (news.studentsnepal.com, jobs.studentsnepal.com, quiz.studentsnepal.com, blog.studentsnepal.com). After 3 years, the site has 50,000+ subscribers.</p>\n<p>Currently, StudentsNepal sends 1 newsletter per week, and my dev team and I are planning to make it 2 newsletters per week. We had invited students and educators/institutions to contribute content for the newsletters and the response has been just great! Students, particularly, submit generously and regularly to benefit other members, subscribers, and online visitors.</p>\n<p>In addition, this project has also helped me connect with lots of awesome individuals and similar-minded startup owners.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Design and CSS tweaks</strong><br />\nOut of the box, BuddyPress has a plain and simple design and interfaces which can be customized easily. At the end of the day, the features and performance are what matters most to my users whether on mobile, tablet, or desktop. For me, due to extensibility and ease of customization, BuddyPress reigns as king when it comes to a free open source script for a social network.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-266198\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/Forums-Archive.png\" alt=\"Forums Archive\" width=\"1349\" height=\"1957\" /></p>\n<p><strong>4. Upgrading Servers</strong><br />\nStudentsNepal.com was on a shared hosting plan when I launched it in 2014. It took around 3 to 4 months to cross the benchmark of 500 visitors/day. After getting articles indexed in search engines and started getting higher ranks, StudentsNepal started getting a lot of visitors (especially from Google). Mid-2015 we upgraded to VPS hosting when the website’s articles and contents started getting listed on the 1st page of search engines and it started getting a couple of thousand visitors daily. Based on my experience, it’s a good decision to get a shared hosting plan while the site was starting out and then upgrade to more powerful hosting plan when data showed the increases in user engagement and participation.</p>\n<p>With a community of 9,700 registered members, 50k subscribers, and around 150k visitors/month, I am happy to say that our site runs smoothly with nary a downtime on all devices. If you install BuddyPress, you will need a bit more power on your server.</p>\n<p><strong>Fast Forward</strong></p>\n<p>Future plans for StudentsNepal.com include moving the Shopping and Jobs sections to separate domains and setting up a new site for online classes. I am testing Woocommerce, WP Job Manager, and Moodle for the other projects to expand our services to the community.</p>\n<p>If you are creating a site for any niche community and are not sure on which platform to choose, I definitely suggest using WordPress with BuddyPress. These have a lot of stable and robust add-on plugins to help you create awesome and feature-rich communities.</p>\n<p>StudentsNepal.com is the first website of its nature in Nepal and it has garnered a lot of media attention and praise. I received a lot of positive and encouraging messages from educators and students in Nepal for creating this platform. I’m just glad that the services provided by the site have been very helpful to so many Nepalese students as well to those who would like to study in Nepal.</p>\n<p>Thanks to WordPress and BuddyPress for making this site possible.

I browsed the plugin directory to see if anyone had created a plugin that renamed Excerpts to TL;DR.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t surprised when I discovered <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/too-long-didnt-read/\">TL;DR</a> created by <a href=\"http://ozh.org/\">Ozh Richard</a>. It hasn&#8217;t been updated in more than two years so it won&#8217;t show up in casual searches. It simply renames Excerpt to TL;DR using a filter to replace a string with custom text.</p>\n<h2>Human Made Shares Handbook</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://hmn.md/\">Human Made</a>, a WordPress development agency based in the UK, has <a href=\"https://hmn.md/2017/05/25/handbook/\">published</a> its <a href=\"https://handbook.hmn.md/\">handbook</a> that includes on boarding practices, health and safety policies, and their hiring process.</p>\n<p>While it&#8217;s not a perfect fit for every one, it provides an in-depth look at the principles the company values.

This is something I’ve done before, and it seems to come in cycles, depending on what my business needs.</p>\n<p>Over the years I’ve tried many different things related to marketing, most of them have fallen short. A few things have worked, I thought I’d share some of my journey up to this point.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Women Who WordPress Wapuu!</h2>\n<p>In what is a traditional part of this series, I end each issue by featuring a Wapuu design. For those who don&#8217;t know, Wapuu is the <a href=\"http://wapuu.jp/2015/12/12/wapuu-origins/\">unofficial mascot</a> of the WordPress project.</p>\n<p>The Women Who WP Wapuu represents the <a href=\"https://womenwhowp.org/store/\">Women Who WP group</a>. The group is dedicated to inspiring, connecting, challenging, and educating women throughout the WordPress community, through referrals, networking, workshops and mentorship focused on professional development and WordPress.</p>\n<p>The Women Who WP Wapuu pin was a huge hit at WordCamp Chicago earlier this year.

Pagely, WP Engine, and SiteGround added HHVM hosting options in 2014 and early 2015. However, PHP 7 performance gains have been enough to preclude wider HHVM adoption.</p>\n<p>WordPress core developer John Blackbourn announced yesterday that the project has<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/25/hhvm-no-longer-part-of-wordpress-cores-testing-infrastructure/\" target=\"_blank\"> removed HHVM support in the Travis test suite</a> after April 2017 stats showed a mere several dozen WordPress websites running on HHVM. WordPress never officially supported HHVM but Scott Taylor made <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27881\" target=\"_blank\">many improvements to core for better HHVM compatibility</a> three years ago. Blackbourn clarified on Slack that WordPress is not removing this support but rather will no longer include HHVM in its testing infrastructure.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Support for HHVM itself hasn&#8217;t been dropped, but support for testing WordPress on HHVM has been dropped,&#8221; Blackbourn said. &#8220;HHVM usage is so minuscule (literally in the dozens according to update stats) that we can&#8217;t warrant the time needed to ensure the test infrastructure works.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The change isn&#8217;t likely to affect too many developers, but it&#8217;s an important milestone that signifies how well PHP 7 has been performing for sites that have switched. Blackbourn suggests those running WordPress on HHVM should consider switching to PHP 7+, as it is &#8220;far more widely supported and tested, and offers all of the memory and performance benefits that HHVM pushed forward.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The open source MongoDB project also announced yesterday that it will <a href=\"https://derickrethans.nl/mongodb-hhvm.html\" target=\"_blank\">no longer be supporting its HHVM driver</a>, saying it no longer makes good use of contributors&#8217; engineering time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At the start of 2015 we began work on an HHVM driver for MongoDB, as part of our project to renew our PHP driver,&#8221; Derick Rethans, MongoDB engineer and author of <a href=\"http://xdebug.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Xdebug</a>, said. &#8220;Back then, HHVM was in its ascendancy and outperforming PHP 5.6 two to one. With such a huge performance difference it was reasonable to assume that many users would be switching over&#8230;With PHP 7 released, we saw very little use of the HHVM driver for MongoDB.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These announcements may be the start of more open source projects giving HHVM compatibility a lower priority. On the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40548\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> for removing HHVM from the test matrix on Travis, John Blackbourn thanked HHVM for its importance in helping move PHP forward.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The PHP world owes a lot to HHVM for helping it push it forward,&#8221; Blackbourn said. &#8220;Without HHVM, maybe we wouldn&#8217;t have seen such incredible performance gains in PHP 7.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 May 2017 19:07:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WPTavern: Rainmaker Digital to Partner with Nimble Worldwide\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=70828\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wptavern.com/rainmaker-digital-to-partner-with-nimble-worldwide\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3341:\"<p><a href=\"http://rainmakerdigital.com/\">Rainmaker Digital</a>, formerly known as Copyblogger Media, has <a href=\"http://www.copyblogger.com/rainmaker-services/\">entered into a letter of intent</a> to partner with <a href=\"http://www.nimbleworldwide.com/\">Nimble Worldwide</a>, a marketing agency based in Dallas, TX. Assets from both companies will be combined into a new entity with Rainmaker Digital being the majority owner. Brian Clark, CEO of Rainmaker Digital, says the partnership enables them to transform from a Software as a Service provider to Software and Services.</p>\n<p>&#8220;People need sophisticated marketing technology, yes — but they also need done-for-them services such as design, content, and lead generation strategy,&#8221; Clark said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In that last year, we’ve explored several viable ways to do more for our customers and prospects as a hybrid technology and digital marketing service provider. After careful deliberation, we’ve come up with a path that allows us to expertly provide anything that a Rainmaker user needs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time both companies have worked together. Prior to <a href=\"http://rainmakerplatform.com/platform/tour/email/\">RainMail</a>, Rainmaker&#8217;s in-house email marketing service, the company used Nimble Worldwide as its email marketing provider. Although the partnership brings in a number of new employees under Rainmaker Digital, Clark admits that they had to let some employees go.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This deal provides instant access to an experienced team of digital marketing professionals and a network of talented contractors that ensures our service solutions are expertly crafted and delivered,&#8221; Clark said. &#8220;This grows the Rainmaker team significantly, without the pain and uncertainty of building an agency from scratch.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The change in business model unfortunately left four of our existing employees without positions, along with the loss of some of our own contractors. That was certainly no fun, and our operations leadership preserved every job possible despite the significant reorganization.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Before the end of June, customers will no longer be able to purchase services à la carte. Instead, sales of the platform will be more hands on, bundled with services, and prices will significantly increase. Customers who start a free trial before the end of June will be able to use the platform at a cheaper rate and without the bundled service components.</p>\n<h2>Genesis Framework Remains a Priority</h2>\n<p>StudioPress, Synthesis, Copyblogger, Authority, and DCI are not part of the deal and remain separate entities. Clark says StudioPress sales are going strong and the Genesis Framework is still a priority.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our Synthesis managed WordPress hosting line will be folded into the StudioPress brand at some point, which shows how much we value StudioPress going forward,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Genesis is still in the hands of Nathan Rice, and he&#8217;s moving it forward at a faster pace than in years past when he had to divide time to work on Rainmaker. Now that he&#8217;s free from that, I&#8217;m excited to see where he takes the framework, which will continue to be a part of Rainmaker as well.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 May 2017 17:24:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: WordPress to Select New JavaScript Framework for Use in Core\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=70794\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-to-select-new-javascript-framework-for-use-in-core\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2892:\"<p>WordPress core contributors have started collaborating more around their JavaScript efforts this year with regular core-js meetings.

Most of the discussion centered on the benefits and drawbacks of React vs Vue.</p>\n<p>The majority of those who participated in the meeting seemed to favor React, as it is already used with several major WordPress projects such as Calypso, Gutenberg, and Jetpack. WordPress&#8217; project lead, Matt Mullenweg, has publicly stated that Automattic is betting on React long-term. Mullenweg has also <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-announces-tech-and-design-leads-for-new-focus-based-development-cycle\" target=\"_blank\">expressed a desire for Calypso, or a similar interface, to replace wp-admin</a> in the future.

Proponents of Vue.js find it easy to learn and extend. Those who are advocating for React also cite its extensibility, stability, and its proven use with popular WordPress products.</p>\n<p>Contributors present for the meeting agreed they would be hesitant to commit a new framework to core without using it in some way for a core feature.

This was true when Joost wrote his original <a href=\"https://yoast.com/articles/wordpress-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WordPress SEO</a> article in 2008 (updated every few months) and it&#8217;s still true today, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t improve it further! This plugin is written from the ground up by Joost de Valk and his team at <a href=\"https://yoast.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast</a> to improve your site&#8217;s SEO on <em>all</em> needed aspects. While this <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast SEO plugin</a> goes the extra mile to take care of all the technical optimization, more on that below, it first and foremost helps you write better content.  Yoast SEO forces you to choose a focus keyword when you&#8217;re writing your articles, and then makes sure you use that focus keyword everywhere.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Premium Support</strong><br />\n  The Yoast team does not always provide active support for the Yoast SEO plugin on the WordPress.org forums. One-on-one email support is available to people who bought the <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo-premium/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Premium Yoast SEO plugin</a> only.<br />\n  Note that the Premium SEO plugin has several extra features too, including the option to have multiple focus keywords and a redirect manager, so it might be well worth your investment!</p>\n<p>You should also check out the <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/local-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast Local SEO</a>, <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/news-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast News SEO</a> and <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/video-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast Video SEO</a> extensions to Yoast SEO. These of course come with support too.</p>\n<p><strong>Bug Reports</strong><br />\n  Bug reports for Yoast SEO are <a href=\"https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo\" rel=\"nofollow\">welcomed on GitHub</a>. Please note GitHub is <em>not</em> a support forum, and issues that aren&#8217;t properly qualified as bugs will be closed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Write better content with Yoast SEO</h4>\n<p>Using the snippet preview, you can see a rendering of what your post or page will look like in the search results, whether your title is too long or too short, and whether your meta description makes sense in the context of a search result. This way the plugin will help you not only increase rankings but also increase the click through rate for organic search results.</p>\n<h4>Page Analysis</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugins <a href=\"https://yoast.com/content-seo-wordpress-linkdex/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Page Analysis</a> functionality checks simple things you&#8217;re bound to forget. It checks, for instance, if you have images in your post and whether they have an alt tag containing the focus keyword for that post. It also checks whether your posts are long enough, whether you&#8217;ve written a meta description and if that meta description contains your focus keyword, if you&#8217;ve used any subheadings within your post, etc. etc.</p>\n<p>The plugin alsgruo allows you to write meta titles and descriptions for all your category, tag and custom taxonomy archives, giving you the option to further optimize those pages.</p>\n<p>Combined, this plugin makes sure that your content is the type of content search engines will love!</p>\n<h4>Technical WordPress Search Engine Optimization</h4>\n<p>While out of the box WordPress is pretty good for SEO, it needs some tweaks here and there. This Yoast SEO plugin guides you through some of the settings needed, for instance by reminding you to enable pretty permalinks. But it also goes beyond that, by automatically optimizing and inserting the meta tags and link elements that Google and other search engines like so much:</p>\n<h4>Meta &amp; Link Elements</h4>\n<p>With the Yoast SEO plugin you can control which pages Google shows in its search results and which pages it doesn&#8217;t show. By default, it will tell search engines to index all of your pages, including category and tag archives, but to only show the first pages in the search results. It&#8217;s not very useful for a user to end up on the third page of your &#8220;personal&#8221; category, right?</p>\n<p>WordPress itself only shows canonical link elements on single pages, but Yoast SEO makes it output canonical link elements everywhere. Google has recently announced they would also use <code>rel=\"next\"</code> and <code>rel=\"prev\"</code> link elements in the <code>head</code> section of your paginated archives. This plugin adds those automatically. See <a href=\"https://yoast.com/rel-next-prev-paginated-archives/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this post</a> for more info.</p>\n<h4>XML Sitemaps</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugin has the most advanced XML Sitemaps functionality in any WordPress plugin. Once you check the box, it automatically creates XML sitemaps and notifies Google &amp; Bing of the sitemaps&#8217; existence. These XML sitemaps include the images in your posts &amp; pages too, so that your images may be found better in the search engines too.</p>\n<p>These XML Sitemaps will even work on large sites, because of how they&#8217;re created, using one index sitemap that links to sub-sitemaps for each 1,000 posts. They will also work with custom post types and custom taxonomies automatically, while giving you the option to remove those from the XML sitemap should you wish to.</p>\n<p>Because of using <a href=\"https://yoast.com/xsl-stylesheet-xml-sitemap/\" rel=\"nofollow\">XSL stylesheets for these XML Sitemaps</a>, the XML sitemaps are easily readable for the human eye too, so you can spot things that shouldn&#8217;t be in there.</p>\n<h4>RSS Optimization</h4>\n<p>Are you being outranked by scrapers? Instead of cursing at them, use them to your advantage! By automatically adding a link to your RSS feed pointing back to the original article, you&#8217;re telling the search engine where they should be looking for the original. This way, the Yoast SEO plugin increases your own chance of ranking for your chosen keywords and gets rid of scrapers in one go!</p>\n<h4>Breadcrumbs</h4>\n<p>If your theme is compatible, and themes based on for instance Genesis or by WooThemes often are, you can use the built-in Breadcrumbs functionality. This allows you to create an easy navigation that is great for both users and search engines, and will support the search engines in understanding the structure of your site.</p>\n<p>Making your theme compatible isn&#8217;t hard either, check <a href=\"https://kb.yoast.com/kb/implement-wordpress-seo-breadcrumbs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">these instructions</a>.</p>\n<h4>Edit your .htaccess and robots.txt file</h4>\n<p>Using the built-in file editor, you can edit your WordPress blog&#8217;s <code>.htaccess</code> and <code>robots.txt</code> file, giving you direct access to the two most powerful files, from an SEO perspective, in your WordPress install.</p>\n<h4>Social Integration</h4>\n<p>SEO and Social Media are heavily intertwined. That&#8217;s why this plugin also comes with a Facebook OpenGraph implementation and will soon also support Google+ sharing tags.</p>\n<h4>Multi-Site Compatible</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugin, unlike some others, is fully Multi-Site compatible. The XML Sitemaps work fine in all setups and you even have the option, in the Network settings, to copy the settings from one blog to another, or make blogs default to the settings for a specific blog.</p>\n<h4>Import &amp; Export functionality</h4>\n<p>If you have multiple blogs, setting up plugins like this one on all of them might seem like a daunting task. Except that it&#8217;s not, because what you can do is simple: you set up the plugin once. You then export your settings and simply import them on all your other sites. It&#8217;s that simple!</p>\n<h4>Import functionality for other WordPress SEO plugins</h4>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve used All In One SEO Pack or HeadSpace2 before using this plugin, you might want to import all your old titles and descriptions. You can do that easily using the built-in import functionality. There&#8217;s also import functionality for some of the older Yoast plugins, like Robots Meta and RSS footer.</p>\n<p>Should you have a need to import from another SEO plugin to Yoast SEO, or from a theme like Genesis or Thesis, you can use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/seo-data-transporter/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SEO Data Transporter</a> plugin, which will easily convert your SEO meta data from and to a whole set of plugins like Platinum SEO, SEO Ultimate, Greg&#8217;s High Performance SEO, and themes like Headway, Hybrid, WooFramework, Catalyst etc.</p>\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://yoast.com/all-in-one-seo-pack-migration/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this migration guide</a> if you still have questions about migrating from another SEO plugin to Yoast SEO.</p>\n<h4>Yoast SEO Plugin in your Language!</h4>\n<p>Currently a huge translation project is underway, translating Yoast SEO in as much as 24 languages. So far, the translations for French and Dutch are complete, but we still need help on a lot of other languages, so if you&#8217;re good at translating, please join us at <a href=\"http://translate.yoast.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">translate.yoast.com</a>.</p>\n<h4>News SEO</h4>\n<p>Be sure to also check out the premium <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/news-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">News SEO module</a> if you need Google News Sitemaps.

Perhaps you’d like to sell monthly subscriptions for physical goods, or offer your members a discount on digital downloads? It’s all possible.</p>\n<h4>Ship wherever you like</h4>\n<p>Offer free shipping, flat rate shipping, or make real-time calculations. Limit your shipments to specific countries, or open your store up to the world. Shipping is highly configurable, and WooCommerce even supports drop shipping.</p>\n<h4>Extensive payment options</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce comes bundled with the ability to accept major credit cards, PayPal, BACS (bank transfers), and cash on delivery. Need additional options? More than 140 region-specific gateways integrate with WooCommerce, including popular choices like Stripe, Authorize.Net, and Amazon Payments.</p>\n<h4>You control it all &#8212; forever</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce gives you complete control of your store, from taxes to stock levels to customer accounts. Add and remove extensions, change your design, and switch settings as you please. It’s all under your control.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest risks of using a hosted eCommerce platform is what happens to your store if the provider closes up shop. With WooCommerce, you have complete control, so there’s never any reason to worry. Your data belongs to you &#8212; and it’s kept secure, thanks to regular audits by industry leaders.</p>\n<h4>Define your style with Storefront</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storefront</a> is a free WordPress theme available to any WooCommerce store. Along with deep WooCommerce integration, Storefront prioritizes speed and uptime while eliminating theme and plugin conflicts during major updates.</p>\n<p>Define your style even further by customizing Storefront to your liking or choosing from one of our several <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/product-category/themes/storefront-child-theme-themes/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storefront child themes</a>. It’s all up to you, and all open source.</p>\n<h4>Built with developers in mind</h4>\n<p>Extendable, adaptable, and open source &#8212; WooCommerce was created with developers in mind. With its strong, robust framework, you can scale your client’s store all the way from basic to high-end (infinity and beyond).</p>\n<p>Built with a REST API, WooCommerce can integrate with virtually any service. Your store’s data can be accessed anywhere, anytime, 100% securely. WooCommerce allows developers to easily create, modify, and grow a store that meets their specifications.</p>\n<p>No matter the size of the store you want to build, WooCommerce will scale to meet your requirements. With a growing collection of more than 300 extensions, you can enhance each store’s features to meet your client’s unique needs &#8212; or even create your own solution.</p>\n<p>If security is a concern, rest easy. WooCommerce is audited by a dedicated team of developers working around the clock to identify and patch any and all discovered bugs.</p>\n<p>We also support WooCommerce and all its extensions with comprehensive, easily-accessible documentation. With our docs, you’ll learn how to create the exact site your client needs.</p>\n<h4>Extensions galore</h4>\n<p>WordPress.org is home to some amazing extensions for WooCommerce, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-google-analytics-integration/\">Google Analytics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-delivery-notes/\">Delivery Notes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/\">PDF Invoices and Packing Slips</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/affiliates-woocommerce-light/\">Affiliates Integration Light</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-new-product-badge/\">New Product Badges</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keen to see them all?

Once you’ve found our eCommerce plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading our eCommerce plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow\">instructions on how to do this here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Updating</h4>\n<p>Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.</p>\n<p>If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress &gt; Settings &gt; Permalinks and hitting &#8216;save&#8217;. That should return things to normal.</p>\n<h4>Dummy data</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce comes with some dummy data you can use to see how products look; either import dummy_data.xml via the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/\">WordPress importer</a> or use our <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/product-csv-import-suite/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CSV Import Suite plugin</a> to import dummy_data.csv and dummy_data_variations.csv.</p>\n<p><!--section=faq--></p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Installation Instructions</dt>\n<dd>\n<h4>Minimum Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP version 5.2.4 or greater (PHP 5.6 or greater is recommended)</li>\n<li>MySQL version 5.0 or greater (MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended)</li>\n<li>Some payment gateways require fsockopen support (for IPN access)</li>\n<li>WooCommerce 2.5 requires WordPress 4.1+</li>\n<li>WooCommerce 2.6 requires WordPress 4.4+</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Visit the <a href=\"https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/server-requirements/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WooCommerce server requirements documentation</a> for a detailed list of server requirements.</p>\n<h4>Automatic installation</h4>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser.

You should then use the &#8220;Restore Lockouts&#8221; button on the plugin settings page and remove the whitelist function again.</p>\n<p>If you have ftp / ssh access to the site rename the file &#8220;wp-content/plugins/limit-login-attempts/limit-login-attempts.php&#8221; to deactivate the plugin.</p>\n<p>If you have access to the database (for example through phpMyAdmin) you can clear the limit_login_lockouts option in the wordpress options table.

Please upgrade immediately.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Auth cookies&#8221; are special cookies set at login that authenticating you to the system. It is how WordPress &#8220;remembers&#8221; that you are logged in between page loads.</p>\n<p>During lockout these are supposed to be cleared, but a change in 1.6.2 broke this. It allowed an attacker to keep trying to break these cookies during a lockout.</p>\n<p>Lockout of normal password login attempts still worked as it should, and it appears that all &#8220;auth cookie&#8221; attempts would keep getting logged.</p>\n<p>In theory the &#8220;auth cookie&#8221; is quite resistant to brute force attack. It contains a cryptographic hash of the user password, and the difficulty to break it is not based on the password strength but instead on the cryptographic operations used and the length of the hash value. In theory it should take many many years to break this hash. As theory and practice does not always agree it is still a good idea to have working lockouts of any such attempts.</p>\n<h4>1.7.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added filter that allows whitelisting IP.

There are still some problems with cookie auth handling.
